    "content": "Search Results Can a traditional search result be removed from DuckDuckGo? DuckDuckGo search results come from a combination of sources as they are a mixture of different search modules (for examples, images, news, etc.), Instant Answers (for example, definitions, calculations, etc.), and traditional links. See this help page for more information on where DuckDuckGo search results come from. As explained on that page, while most non-traditional search results come from DuckDuckGo and other sources, most traditional search results currently come from Bing. So, to request removal of traditional links that appear in search results, you will need to submit your request directly to Bing first. The links below provide next steps to complete your request with Bing: Bing Removal (EU citizens) Bing Removal (Non-EU citizens) After completing your request with Bing, once verified, changes will automatically be reflected in DuckDuckGo search results. If you have already submitted a request to Bing and the removed links are still appearing in DuckDuckGo search results, please email privacy@duckduckgo.com , as it may indicate the result is from another source.

    "content": "Search Results Why doesn't DuckDuckGo Search display the number of results? We get results from a variety of sources (including our own). Because of this unique way of generating results, we cannot easily determine the number of results for a particular search ahead of time. That's why we do not display such a number in our search results. In addition, there are a bunch of reasons you may not be getting as many results as you think you should for a particular query. We try to be very exact based on what you type in, whereas other search engines often change your query around a bit. So that is the first thing to look at. That is, if you slightly change your query do you get more results? Related to exactness, it could be your use of punctuation . We could have had a brief outage on our side. You could try a hard refresh (usually ctrl/cmd-R) to clear your cache and try again. If none of these apply, and you are still getting sparse results for a search you think really should be giving you more results, please send in the specific search .

    "title": "How do news rankings work on DuckDuckGo Search? - DuckDuckGo Help Pages",
    "content": "Search Results How do news rankings work on DuckDuckGo Search? A search engine's primary job is to rank results. In other words, search engines try to put results that most quickly and accurately answer the query on top. At DuckDuckGo we produce search results from a variety of sources , and when we apply our own ranking signals we do so in a strictly non-political manner, meaning we don't evaluate or otherwise take into account any potential political bias or leanings of websites in our search result rankings. Similarly, outside of our clearly labeled ads, we do not accept compensation to influence search result rankings. For many news events, hundreds of media outlets create similar articles, and many of those articles have similar relevancy in terms of keyword matching and popularity. As such, for news-related searches we look to another ranking factor to try to ensure the top few news results aren't obviously very low-quality so users can immediately have several sources of relevant, quality news results to compare and choose between. The non-political factor we've found to help accomplish this ranking is a well-documented history of a site's extremely low journalistic standards, correlated with: routinely using spam or clickbait to artificially inflate traffic, consistently publishing stories without citing sources, censoring stories due to operating with very limited press freedom, and misleading readers about who owns, funds, and authors stories for the site. Many sites may occasionally do one or more of these things, but we take action very rarely, only in the most extreme cases. To identify these rare, extreme cases, we rely on multiple non-governmental and non-political organizations that specialize in objectively assessing journalistic standards. To take any ranking action using this factor, we must see at least three of these organizations independently assess a site as having extremely low journalistic standards and also see that none of these organizations have assessed the same site as having even somewhat robust journalistic standards. We trust that users can find the right information for themselves, so even in these rare cases we do not remove these sites from our search results page. Additionally, impacted sites are not moved so far down in the results that they are effectively removed. Unless legally prohibited, you should find all media outlets in our results, and they should generally show on top if you search for them by name or domain name. If you see otherwise, please let us know and we will investigate. Learn More What search features does DuckDuckGo Search have? What search improvements has DuckDuckGo made recently?

AI-assisted answers, previously called DuckAssist, are an optional feature in our search results that can anonymously generate answers to search queries. To do this, we scan the web for relevant content and use AI-powered natural language technology to generate a brief answer based on the information found. AI-assisted responses always link directly to one or two sources, citing where the answer came from, so you can easily go and get more detailed information. It’s important to remember that responses are auto-generated from cited sources, based on crawling the web . AI-assisted answers are fully optional. Decide if you want to see them often, sometimes (the default setting), on demand, or never in your Search Settings . Phrasing your search as a complete question makes AI-assisted answers more likely to appear automatically and often yields better answers. AI-assisted answers do not support follow-up questions. However, you can easily continue your conversation in Duck.ai , our private AI-powered chat service that supports chat models from OpenAI, Anthropic and more.

In browser cookies, which you can see in the, \"Bookmarklet and settings data\" link on the settings page . What information gets saved? Only the settings that you have changed. They are detailed on the URL Parameters page . What does \"cloud save\" mean? If you choose, you can save your settings more permanently by entering a passphrase. This has a few benefits: you can share your settings among computers and browsers you can restore your settings after deleting cookies you can store several sets of settings for different purposes \"Cloud computing\" is an umbrella term for scalable third party data and software services. For Cloud Save we use Amazon S3 . How does it work? Your passphrase is used to generate a key using the Secure Hash Algorithm known as SHA-2 , using a 512 bit key. Your passphrase never leaves the browser, only the key and the settings file associated with it. We save the settings file on Amazon S3 using the generated key as the name. In the interest of transparency, this data is not encrypted: you can see exactly what information we store. Passphrases cannot feasibly be reverse engineered from a key - even if you could do that, there is no point since all the information is there in the open, unencrypted, provided you know the key. DuckDuckGo does not ever know your passphrase. How is it anonymous? We do not have usernames and we don't store any personally identifiable information. How does passphrase generation work? Each time you ask for a passphrase suggestion, we get a reasonably large list of random words from the DuckDuckGo servers. In the browser, we then select four or five random words from that list, ensuring that it is at least 18-20 characters long. It is easier to remember four or five words than 10 random letters and numbers, and far more secure. How do I change my passphrase? You can do this by saving your settings under a different passphrase, optionally deleting the first set. Enable cloud save by entering your existing passphrase. Push \"Delete my data\". This removes the data from the cloud, but it remains in your browser until you click on \"reset all settings to defaults\". Enter a new passphrase and click \"Save Settings\". This will save your data under your new passphrase. I forgot my passphrase. Can you recover it? No. Unless you deleted your settings, the settings file will still be there but we have no way of associating it with you. We cannot reverse the passphrase key generation. We don't associate your IP address or browser fingerprint or any other information with the file. Is deleted data really deleted? Yes. What is \"JSON\"? JavaScript Object Notation - a simple, human-readable data format. Learn More What search features does DuckDuckGo Search have? What search improvements has DuckDuckGo made recently?

    "content": "Search Results Where do DuckDuckGo search results come from? When people search, we believe they're really looking for answers, as opposed to just links. For many categories of searches (restaurants, lyrics, sports scores, etc.), there is usually a specialized search engine (e.g., Tripadvisor), content site (e.g., Musixmatch), or dedicated source (e.g., Sportradar) that does a better job of actually answering searches than a general search engine can with just links. Our long-term goal is to get you Instant Answers from these best sources. Most of our search result pages feature one or more Instant Answers. To deliver Instant Answers on specific topics, DuckDuckGo leverages many sources, including specialized sources like Sportradar and crowd-sourced sites like Wikipedia. We also maintain our own crawler (DuckDuckBot) and many indexes to support our results. Of course, we have more traditional links and images in our search results too, which we largely source from Bing. Our focus is synthesizing all these sources to create a superior search experience. Partners and Privacy: As per our strict privacy policy , we never share any personal information with any of our partners that could lead to the creation of search histories. When we send a request to a partner for information used in search results, the transfer of information is proxied through our servers so it stays anonymous. That means our partners see those requests as though they came from us instead of our users, and no unique identifiers are passed in that process (e.g., your IP address). That way, we can work with partners to produce relevant search result pages, while keeping you anonymous to them (and us!). Learn More What search features does DuckDuckGo Search have?

What is FastPeopleSearch? FastPeopleSearch is a data broker, compiling publicly available personal information and making it publicly accessible. FastPeopleSearch gathers data from government records, other data brokers, and various online sources to create detailed profiles for individual American citizens. These profiles are likely to include the following personal information: Full name (and previous names) Current and past addresses Phone numbers and email addresses Age and birthdate Relatives, neighbors, and associates Property ownership, arrest records, and more While FastPeopleSearch promotes itself as a tool for reconnecting with people, it also exposes private details that could lead to misuse. How does FastPeopleSearch get my information? FastPeopleSearch collects data from various public sources, such as: Public Records and Government Databases: Including voter registration data, property records, court documents, and business registrations Third-Party Data Brokers: Specifically, companies that buy, sell, and distribute consumer information collected from online registrations, surveys, or transactions Social Media and Internet Activity: Publicly shared and available information on sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, X/Twitter, and other platforms Utility Records and Phone Directories: If a phone number or address has been publicly listed somewhere, odds are high it will appear on FastPeopleSearch Since FastPeopleSearch updates automatically, your information may reappear even after a successful opt-out, requiring ongoing privacy management. My personal info is still in search engines. Why? Even after removal, your name might still appear in search results. This happens because search engines like Google and Bing cache older pages and update periodically. To remove outdated FastPeopleSearch content from Google, you can use their removal tool for personally identifiable information (PII), found here . To remove content from Bing, use this link . DuckDuckGo results can also be removed via Bing. More on that process here . Most search engines update and re-index the info in their search results anywhere from every few days to every few weeks. If a listing from FastPeopleSearch with your PII appears in search results, check back later or submit a new request. Frequently Asked Questions About FastPeopleSearch Removal Can I remove my information permanently? Yes, but your data may reappear over time as FastPeopleSearch updates its database. It’s recommended to check periodically and to resubmit opt-out requests if necessary. Does FastPeopleSearch sell my information? No, but it aggregates data from third-party brokers. If you click through to purchase a report from FastPeopleSearch, it processes through PeopleFinders, another people search site. Will this remove my data from other sites? Removing your personal information from FastPeopleSearch will simultaneously remove it from other sites such as PeopleFinders, SmartBackgroundChecks, and others. Submitting a FastPeopleSearch removal will also make it more difficult for other data brokers to obtain the information gathered and shared from FastPeopleSearch. Are there automatic removal services? There are data removal services online specializing in removing personal information from people search sites.

    "title": "How to Choose the Best VPN: 6 Factors to Consider - DuckDuckGo Help Pages",
    "content": "Privacy Guides / VPN How to Choose the Best VPN: 6 Factors to Consider How to Choose the Best VPN Want to choose the best VPN for your needs? There are a few factors to consider. Some of the most common are price; number and location of servers offered; data caps; and the provider’s reputation and privacy practices. We dig into each of these factors below. VPN Pricing and Subscription Model VPN services typically offer varied pricing. When selecting the best VPN for your needs, it's crucial to balance affordability with the quality of the service. This helps to ensure your online privacy and security needs are met without compromise. Opting for a longer commitment can unlock savings. Before making that investment in your digital safety, just be sure to confirm that your chosen VPN delivers the speed and security you’re looking for. You’ll also want to check that it’s compatible with all your devices. Are Free VPNs Worth It? When you start looking for a VPN, one of the first things you’ll notice is that there are a lot of choices, both free and paid. It’s worth remembering that picking a VPNs is akin to making any purchase — you get what you pay for . The best VPN providers have strong privacy policies and security practices. Some of these legitimate services do offer both free and paid tiers. The paid versions are often more robust than their free counterparts, offering higher data limits, access to servers near you, and so on. Some free or low-quality VPNs, on the other hand, carry more risks than just slow connection speeds. Trustworthy VPN providers usually have a no-logging policy, meaning they don’t store any information about your online activities. This is not the case with less reputable companies, who may sell your personal information to third parties. As with any software, it’s good to review the privacy policy and user agreement before signing up. VPN Data Caps or Allowances Data caps limit the amount of data you can send through VPN servers every month. These caps can make a big difference when you choose a VPN, especially if your online activities demand a lot of data, like gaming or streaming. When shopping for a VPN, look for one that combines both speed with reliability. If you want to avoid data limitations altogether, consider a VPN that offers unlimited bandwidth, ensuring your internet usage remains uninterrupted and secure. VPN Servers and Locations The number of servers and server locations offered by your VPN can have a big impact on day-to-day performance. Connecting to a server near you is generally faster than connecting to one far away, for example. High-quality VPNs have plenty of servers in multiple countries, so you can get the fastest possible connection speed wherever you are. Reputation of the VPN Provider You should always investigate a VPN provider's reputation before signing up. By necessity, all your internet traffic and data passes through your VPN, so you want to make sure you're not opening yourself up to more risk. Looking at a combination of user reviews and expert opinions can be helpful. Don’t forget to check the company’s history for any data breaches or privacy issues. Trustworthy VPN providers are transparent about their privacy policies, security practices, and logging activities. That transparency can signal a commitment to user privacy and data protection. At DuckDuckGo, for example, we don’t track you – that’s our privacy policy in a nutshell. And our VPN is no exception ! Fast, secure, and anonymous, the DuckDuckGo VPN is included in Privacy Pro , our 3-in-1 privacy subscription service. Take extra care when vetting free VPN services. You’ll want to know whether you’re dealing with a trusted provider that offers a free tier of service, or a less reputable company that makes money by selling anonymized user data, which is usually the data you’re trying to protect. VPN Privacy Policy It's crucial to review VPN privacy policies thoroughly before signing up. You’ll want to understand if providers collect and use data, especially if they share it with third parties. The best VPN options maintain a stringent no-logging policy, guaranteeing that your online activity isn’t tracked or stored. A transparent privacy policy will explain how the VPN safeguards your personal information. This information is critical to review if you want to be sure that your data will be protected and managed according to your needs. Our transparent privacy policy for the DuckDuckGo VPN – and the rest of Privacy Pro! – is available here . Learn More Why Use a VPN? 5 Common VPN Use Cases and More What Does a VPN Do?

    "content": "Privacy Guides / VPN What Does a VPN Do? How Does a VPN Work? What Does a VPN Do? How Does a VPN Work? When you use a VPN, you’re creating a secure and encrypted “tunnel” for internet traffic between your device and the wider internet — including the websites you visit and the apps you use. This prevents outsiders from intercepting and reading your data. Using a VPN also enhances online privacy by hiding your IP address, which keeps your browsing activity anonymous and mostly untraceable. Below, we dig into what VPNs hide and how they do it. We also explore how encryption and tunnelling work, and compare the most common VPN protocols: What Does a VPN Hide? How Does a VPN Hide My IP Address? How Does Encryption Work? How Does Tunneling Work? Comparing VPN Protocols What Do VPNs Hide? Protecting your connection with a VPN encrypts your internet traffic. This conceals your browsing history, location data, and other personal info from outsiders. When you use a VPN, your online actions become invisible to your ISP, and makes it more difficult for identity thieves and hackers to get your information. How Does a VPN Hide My IP Address? Your IP address is typically assigned based on the physical location of your computer or phone. When your internet connection is routed through a VPN server, that location-based IP address is replaced with the VPN server’s address. Once this happens, the websites and online services you’re using see the VPN's IP address instead of yours, masking your physical location and contributing to your online anonymity. How Does Encryption Work? Encryption acts like a digital lockbox. It turns your data into a “secret code” during transmission. This means even if someone intercepts your data (like your ISP), without the unique decryption key for your device and VPN, it remains unreadable. VPNs employ this technology to create secure tunnels for your internet traffic. Once you connect, everything you do online is effectively shielded from outside eyes. This encrypted connection also helps preserve your privacy, ensuring only you can access your information. How Does Tunneling Work? Tunneling technology wraps your data in highly secure “packets” for its journey across the internet, effectively enabling it to traverse public networks with a high degree of safety. This process not only conceals the nature and destination of your internet traffic, but also significantly enhances the security of your online activities by shielding them from potential surveillance and unauthorized access. Comparing VPN Protocols VPN protocols determine how data is transmitted and encrypted between your device and the VPN server. These protocols affect VPN speed, security, and reliability. The five most common protocols are: WireGuard is a modern open-source VPN protocol known for simplicity and high-speed performance, utilizing state-of-the-art cryptography to provide secure, efficient connections. (The DuckDuckGo VPN uses WireGuard.) OpenVPN is a customizable open-source protocol offering robust security and compatibility with a wide range of devices, making it a popular choice for its flexibility and reliability. Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP) is a Microsoft-developed protocol that excels in bypassing firewalls and provides strong security by using SSL/TLS encryption over TCP port 443 . Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) combined with IPSec is a fast and secure protocol, known for stability and ability to quickly re-establish a VPN connection in case of temporary disconnection. Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) combined with IPSec is a widely used protocol providing a good balance between security and speed. However, it may be slower than more modern protocols like WireGuard.

    "content": "Privacy Guides / VPN Why Use a VPN? 5 Common VPN Use Cases and More Why Use a VPN? Why would someone use a VPN? If you’re looking to enhance your online privacy, a VPN can help by: Securing your activity on public networks, like free Wi-Fi at airports and cafés when you’re away from home. Keeping your sensitive personal information safe when browsing the web and performing online banking transactions. Stopping your internet service provider (ISP) from tracking you or throttling your connection when streaming. Masking your IP address to help you remain anonymous while browsing the web. Below, we dive into five of the most common use cases for using a VPN: Using a VPN for Travel Using a VPN on Public Wi-Fi Using a VPN for Streaming Using a VPN While Shopping or Browsing the Web Using a VPN When Seeking Anonymity Using a VPN for Travel If you’re a frequent traveler, there are lots of reasons to try a VPN. A VPN enhances your online security by encrypting your internet connection, which is particularly useful on public Wi-Fi networks found in airports, hotels, and cafes. This encryption helps protect your personal information from cyber threats and maintains your digital privacy regardless of your location. VPNs also ensure you remain connected to your usual services securely, without compromising your data's safety. If you’re traveling someplace with stringent regulations or widespread network vulnerabilities, a VPN can help you avoid surveillance and data theft. Using a VPN on Public Wi-Fi Public Wi-Fi is convenient, but there are inherent privacy risks to connecting to insecure networks that a VPN can help you avoid. For example, cybercriminals can use public connections to intercept sensitive information, like your passwords and banking details. VPNs make public Wi-Fi safer to use, encrypting your data to protect it from hackers and other bad actors. Using a VPN for Streaming Do you notice your internet connection slowing down when you’re gaming or streaming video content? Some ISPs ‘throttle’ or ‘shape’ their customers’ connections based on the time of day, type of activity, and more. Using a VPN for streaming or gaming can help you get around these limitations. Using a VPN While Shopping or Browsing the Web VPNs are also useful for day-to-day tasks like online shopping. Securing your connection with a VPN helps protect your credit card number, billing address, and other sensitive data from bad actors. Some companies, like airlines , adjust their prices based on customers’ locations and browsing activity. By hiding that information, VPNs may help you find better deals on certain products and services. Finally, because they keep your online activity anonymous, VPNs can prevent advertisers from serving you targeted ads based on your browsing history. If you’re looking for even more protection from invasive advertising, the DuckDuckGo browser blocks the 3rd-party trackers behind targeted ads before they even load. Get it for iPhone, Android, Windows, and Mac. Using a VPN When Seeking Anonymity Looking to keep your online identity under wraps? A VPN can help with that. By masking your IP address and encrypting your internet connection, a VPN keeps your browsing, shopping, and chat histories private. This is crucial if your goal is to avoid tracking by websites, ISPs, and nosy third parties. Whether you're researching sensitive topics or just value your privacy, a VPN offers the anonymity you need to stay off the radar. Pros and Cons of VPN Usage As you’re considering which VPN is right for you, it’s important to consider both the pros and the cons. While a VPN from a trusted provider can keep you more private and secure by encrypting your internet connection and hiding your IP address, some low-quality VPNs actually pose more of a privacy risk than the protection they claim to offer. In addition, using a VPN can slow down your internet speed. Choosing a VPN that uses tested protocols with higher quality server hardware, like WireGuard, will help minimize speed decreases by comparison. Below we’ve outlined some of the more common VPN benefits and potential drawbacks. Benefits of VPN Usage A good VPN can do a lot for you. VPNs create a secure, encrypted “tunnel” for all your internet traffic, masking your IP address, obscuring your physical location, and preventing outsiders from intercepting your data in transit. VPNs make it safer to use public Wi-Fi if you’re away from home. When online banking, VPNs help secure your sensitive financial information. Shopping for airline tickets? A VPN might even save you money. VPNs also stop your internet service provider (ISP) from tracking you or slowing down your connection speed based on used bandwidth. Potential VPN Disadvantages There are potential downsides to using a VPN, especially if it’s not from a reputable provider. Some VPNs may slow down your internet connection, others may have a very limited data allowance, or they might not be compatible with all types of devices, apps, or sites. Some VPNs can also pose privacy concerns. For example, if your VPN provider isn't transparent about their logging practices, they may be gathering your data and selling it to third parties behind the scenes. Even if they claim that the data is anonymized, it’s worth considering a VPN provider with a clear “no-logging” policy instead, which helps avoid any unexpected privacy violations. VPN FAQ: Answering Frequently Asked Questions Here are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about VPNs. What does VPN stand for? VPN stands for Virtual Private Network, a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, typically the wider internet. Can my ISP see what sites I visit with VPN services on? The short answer is, no. When you use a VPN, your ISP only sees encrypted data flowing between your device and your VPN server. They can’t see the specific websites you’re visiting. This also cloaks your internet footprint from bad actors, online tracking, and more. However, if your DNS settings are configured to default to your ISP’s DNS resolvers, a VPN won’t protect you from your ISP. Most VPNs route DNS queries through the VPN tunnel to their own DNS resolvers, which provides an additional layer of protection from ISP tracking. Be on the lookout for this distinction when selecting the best VPN for your needs. For a deeper dive into DNS settings, check out this guide from Cloudflare. How secure is a VPN really? The level of security provided by a VPN depends on its encryption protocols and its operational policies. The most secure VPNs implement robust encryption techniques and uphold stringent no-logging policies, offering virtually fortress-like security for your digital footprint. What is a remote access VPN? A remote access VPN lets users securely connect to a private network from a remote location. This type of VPN is generally used by businesses, rather than individuals. For example, some remote access VPNs allow employees to securely access company resources from outside the office. Will using a VPN slow down my Internet speeds? All VPN usage will likely result in some reduction in speed. The best VPN providers will use protocols that minimize speed decreases, such as WireGuard (used in the DuckDuckGo VPN). Additionally, a VPN provider that uses higher-quality server hardware can support more overall bandwidth. What is a double VPN? Double VPNs route your internet traffic through two VPN servers, instead of one. This adds an extra layer of encryption and makes your activity even harder to trace, typically at the detriment of browsing speed. How do I choose a browser VPN? When picking a VPN, you can sign up for a standalone service, typically accessed through an app, or you can choose a browser that has a VPN built right in, removing the need for an extra app. (The DuckDuckGo VPN works this way; sign up for DuckDuckGo Privacy Pro through our browser and get full coverage for up to five devices at once.) The ideal browser VPN won’t interfere with your browsing experience. It should be seamlessly integrated and easy to use. Browser VPNs and standalone VPNs work in almost the same way, so you’ll want to evaluate a browser VPN with the same criteria in mind: speed, privacy and security, server locations, price, and so on.

    "content": "Privacy Guides What is a VPN? What Is a VPN? A VPN, or “virtual private network,” is a cybersecurity tool that creates a private and encrypted connection for internet traffic to and from your device by routing it through a remote server. This encrypted connection, often referred to as a “tunnel,” keeps your online activities private and prevents outsiders from intercepting your data. Routing your internet traffic connection through a VPN server also masks your IP address, the numerical label that identifies your individual device when you connect to a network. Your IP address can be used to track you across the Internet and provide information about your general location. When your traffic routes through a remote VPN server, the websites you visit won’t see your real IP address – they'll see that server’s IP address instead. This makes your online actions mostly untraceable back to you. Not sure where to start? These guides answer common questions about how VPNs work, how to choose the best one for your needs, and more: Why Use a VPN? Four VPN Use Cases and More What Does a VPN Do? How Does a VPN Work? How to Choose the Best VPN: 6 Factors to Consider At the end of the day, the best VPN for you will depend on a variety of factors, including security, speed, server locations, price, and the providers’ privacy practices. Will you be using your VPN for high-bandwidth activities, or across multiple devices? Is digital privacy a concern to you? Select a service with a strong reputation that balances those factors with reliable performance. Did you know that DuckDuckGo offers an anonymous VPN?

    "content": "Privacy Guides / Identity Theft How To Prevent Identity Theft: 8 Best Identity Theft Protection Tips How to Prevent Identity Theft: 8 Best Identity Theft Protection Tips Preventing identity theft can seem daunting. However, there are plenty of simple steps you can take to secure your sensitive information. Stay vigilant about your digital footprint and personal data exposure to minimize risks. You should also keep track of the security measures you use for your sensitive accounts and documents. Below are some of the best identity theft protection tips to get you started with good habits. Tip #1: Keep Track of Physical Mail and Bank Statements Looking to keep sensitive information out of your mailbox? One surefire way to decrease the threat of sensitive documents being intercepted is to decrease the volume of mail you receive. Many banks, insurance companies, and utility companies offer electronic billing. Consider opting to get your bills and statements by email to reduce the risk of thieves intercepting your physical mail. If you prefer paper billing, check your mailbox regularly – and consider a lockable mailbox for added security. Whenever new documents arrive, you should either store them securely or shred them right away. This can help prevent mail theft and “dumpster diving.” Finally – planning a long trip? If you’re going to be away for a while, consider having the post office hold your mail for you. The United States Postal Service (USPS) can keep your mail at your local post office for up to 30 days. More information is available on this here . For longer periods of time, USPS offers a forwarding service. Contact your post office directly for instructions on how to do so or read this for further reference. Tip #2: Opt Out of Credit Card Offers Whenever Possible Unsolicited credit card offers are a common target for identity thieves. But you can minimize exposure to credit card fraud by reducing how much unsolicited “junk mail” you receive. The Federal Trade Commission recommends using the official OptOutPrescreen site to limit those pre-approved offers for credit or insurance. You can opt out of credit card offers for five years at a time using the online form or download a paper form to opt out permanently. To note, OptOutPrescreen will ask for some personal information, including your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth. The information you provide is confidential and is used only to process your opt out request. Tip #3: Routinely Check Your Credit Report Consider requesting and reviewing your credit report for unauthorized activity. It’s wise to do this at least once a year – just be careful to avoid credit report-related scams ! Wondering how to get a free credit report without compromising your safety? According to the FTC, only one website – AnnualCreditReport.com – is authorized to fill orders for the free annual credit reports you are entitled to by law. AnnualCreditReport.com also offers free weekly online credit reports from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Visit the FTC’s website for more information. Once you get your report, look for accounts or inquiries you don't recognize, which could indicate identity theft. If you notice inaccuracies or other suspicious activity, report it right away. Tip #4: Avoid Sharing Personally Identifiable Information When Possible Needing to provide your Social Security number to third parties is extremely uncommon. Be suspicious if you are asked to provide your Social Security number, or any other highly personal details, especially in unsolicited calls or emails. You should also feel empowered to ask if you really need to share sensitive information, especially if it doesn’t seem necessary to the transaction, and seek alternative methods of identification when available. Tip #5: Learn How To Remove Your Information From the Internet Regularly search for your name online to monitor and address unauthorized sharing of your personally identifiable information. There are a number of online tools and services to remove your information from data broker sites and search engines. Tip #6: Use Strong Passwords for Online Accounts Create complex passwords using a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. It can be tempting to reuse your favorite passwords, but you should avoid it whenever possible! You can also consider a reputable password manager like Bitwarden or 1Password to generate strong passwords and keep them safe. (The free DuckDuckGo browser also includes a built-in secure password manager that can generate, store, and sync your passwords across multiple devices!) Tip #7: Enable Two-Factor Authentication on All Online Accounts Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to give an extra layer of security to sensitive accounts. Signing in with 2FA requires both a password and a secondary verification method – often a temporary code sent to your mobile phone. When it’s working correctly, it means that no one can access your account(s) without something only you know, like a password, and something only you have in your possession, like a phone. Tip #8: Use an Identity Theft Protection Service for Peace of Mind Consider signing up for a professional identity theft protection service that offers credit monitoring, alerts, and recovery services. Look for services that provide real-time alerts for suspicious activity on your credit report or involving your personal information. When choosing a service, consider one that includes identity restoration assistance and covers costs related to recovering from identity theft. Consider contacting your bank to understand what services they might offer in the event of identity theft.

    "content": "Privacy Guides / Identity Theft What is Identity Theft Protection? A Privacy Guide for 2024 Types of Identity Theft Identity theft can take many forms. Potential ramifications depend on the aims of bad actors and the personally identifiable information, or “PII,” that was compromised in the identity theft. However, some commonalities in identity theft can be identified. Be on the lookout for these common types of identity theft: Credit line identity theft : Identity thieves can use information like your date of birth and Social Security number to apply for credit cards, loans, and other lines of credit. Synthetic identity theft : Bad actors can mix your actual information with fabricated details to forge a “ synthetic ” identity, in other words, a person who doesn’t really exist. Identity thieves can then use those fake identities to open fraudulent accounts and make purchases. Medical identity theft : Your personally identifiable information can be exploited to unlawfully obtain medical services under your name. Tax identity theft : With a target’s Social Security number, identity thieves can commit tax fraud to steal your tax refund. Employment identity theft : Perpetrators can use your identity to gain employment, which can impact your credit, benefit capabilities, and taxes, as well as creating extensive potential legal issues down the road. Unemployment identity theft : Bad actors can claim and intercept your government benefits. Common Identity Theft Warning Signs How do you know if your identity is compromised? Keep an eye out for these identity theft warning signs – and act immediately if you notice any of them! Unfamiliar charges on credit card or bank statements . If you see purchases you don’t recognize, investigate! They may be unauthorized transactions. Missing bills, bank statements, or other paper mail . Identity thieves will sometimes submit change-of-address requests to intercept victims’ mail. Follow up if you notice you’re not receiving your usual mail. Unexpected credit denials . If you generally maintain a good credit standing but have been unexpectedly denied when applying for a credit card or loan, it could indicate that your credit has been damaged by fraudulent financial activity. Unknown accounts on your credit report . See a credit card or loan you don’t recognize when checking your credit report? It could indicate fraud. Collection calls for unknown debts . If you’re getting phone calls from debt collectors about a debt you don’t recognize, it could be a clue that someone fraudulently incurred that debt using your identity. Did you notice one or more of these warning signs in your finances? Read What To Do if Your Identity Is Stolen below for tips on what to do next. What Is Identity Theft Protection? The term “identity theft protection” covers a range of proactive measures you can take to help safeguard your personal and financial information from unauthorized access and fraud. The best identity theft protection practices can include: Regular monitoring of financial accounts and credit reports to spot suspicious activity early on. Increasing security by using secure passwords, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) when available, and storing personal documents in a safe location. Taking immediate action (like placing fraud alerts, freezing your credit, etc.) to prevent new fraudulent accounts from being opened. We discuss all the above and more in our guide How to Prevent Identity Theft: 8 Best Identity Theft Protection Tips Why Is It Important To Have Identity Theft Protection? When it comes to guarding against identity theft, good habits go a long way. Protecting your identity can help mitigate financial loss. If this happens, catching identity theft attempts early can protect your credit standing by stopping fraudsters before they do significant damage. Proactively protecting your identity can reduce the time, effort, and potential cost involved in disrupting fraud and recovering from identity theft. Improving your security measures — both online and offline! — can also reduce your vulnerability to phishing, hacking, and other identity theft methods. Keep your peace of mind by establishing a strong defense against the increasing threat of identity theft. What To Do if Your Identity Is Stolen If you discover that your identity has been compromised, it’s important to act quickly. In the US, you should alert your banks, credit card issuers, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the three major credit bureaus ( Equifax , Experian , and TransUnion ) right away to minimize damage. You’ll also want to change the passwords to any secure online accounts that may have been compromised. Finally, keep detailed records of any communications related to the identity theft incident for legal purposes. This can include phone calls and emails with financial institutions, law enforcement, and more. You may not need it all, but it’s better to be prepared. How To Report Identity Theft As soon as you realize you’ve been the victim of identity theft, consider taking these steps: Report it to the FTC via their consumer website, IdentityTheft.gov , or by calling their hotline at 1-877-438-4338 . Notify the fraud departments of the three major credit bureaus ( Equifax , Experian , and TransUnion ) to place fraud alerts on your credit reports. File a report with the police department. This creates an official record of the identity theft, which is sometimes required by financial institutions during the recovery process. Note: Contact your local police precinct for guidance on how to file a police report for identity theft. Police departments typically have dedicated phone numbers for non-emergency situations, and that’s what you’ll want to use in most cases. How To Put a Freeze on Your Credit Report Did you notice some suspicious activity? Contact each of the three major credit bureaus to request a credit freeze, effectively preventing any new credit accounts from being opened in your name. Freezing your credit is free and can be lifted at any time using a PIN or password provided by the relevant credit bureaus. Just remember that while a credit freeze offers strong protection against fraud, it will require some management, such as temporarily lifting the freeze when you’re applying for credit yourself. Consider an Identity Theft Recovery Service Identity theft is complicated, and it’s always evolving, so you may want to consider signing up for a reputable identity theft recovery service. These services specialize in guiding identity theft victims through the recovery process. Some also offer legal and financial assistance. Shopping around for a service? Look for services that offer direct assistance with disputing fraudulent charges and accounts, as well as helping restore your credit. You might also consider plans that cover out-of-pocket costs related to identity theft recovery, which can be considered additional financial protection.

Apple's App Store now requires all apps to include \"Privacy Details,\" helping users understand more about an app’s data collection practices. At DuckDuckGo, we don’t track you, ever. That’s our privacy policy in a nutshell. For example, we do not create unique cookies and, more generally, architect our product so that we do not even have the ability to create a search or browsing history for any individual — it’s privacy by design. As you can see in the label above, we collect the bare minimum amount of anonymous data (not linked to you) necessary to build and maintain effective privacy products. The DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser mobile app uses just two of the data types listed in Apple's privacy details documentation – \"Usage Data\" and \"Diagnostics\". There is a clear rationale for every piece of anonymous data we use (to improve the app, never to spy on you like other companies), but this anonymous data is not associated with you personally, resulting in the \"Data Not Linked to You\" label. You can use the DuckDuckGo app knowing that the app itself, or its features (like DuckDuckGo Search), aren't tracking you and that we are also helping protect your data on the websites you visit (e.g., through our Tracker Radar and Smarter Encryption technologies). It's important to be aware that even two apps that share the same data privacy label may have different levels of privacy protection under the surface. So our long-standing advice remains: Only install apps from companies and developers that you truly trust, and remove those that you don't use, to reduce your digital footprint. You can get more tips in our privacy newsletters , and if you have any concerns, please feel free to contact us .

    "content": "Legal Platform to Business Regulation (EU 2019/1150) As required by the EU Platform to Business Regulation , this page contains information about how DuckDuckGo ranks results and whether we apply differentiated treatment to our own products and services compared to those offered by other online services. We do not apply any differentiated treatment in our search result rankings to services offered by DuckDuckGo. DuckDuckGo Search result pages consist of three sections: (1) Instant Answers; (2) organic links with images and other modules intertwined; and (3) sponsored links. Instant Answers Most DuckDuckGo Search result pages feature one or more Instant Answers on top. To deliver Instant Answers on specific topics, DuckDuckGo leverages many sources, like Sportradar and Wikipedia. We also use our own indexes for some Instant Answers. Organic Links Most organic links and images in our search results are sourced from Bing . Information about how Bing ranks its content can be found on its Support Page in the section titled “How Bing Ranks Search Results”. When DuckDuckGo applies its own ranking signals to organic links, we do so in a neutral manner, for example, we do not take into account any particular political bias or leanings of websites in our search result rankings. Please see our News Rankings Help Page for further information. Like all search engines, we try to rank egregious spam lower in our search results, and in the rare situation that DuckDuckGo alters the ranking order of organic links or avoids a particular organic link, you may request further information by contacting legal@duckduckgo.com . Subject to applicable law, you may have the right to inspect the contents of any relevant third-party notification or request to alter the ranking order or avoid an organic link. Ads We also display ads adjacent to search results, as explained in our Help Page on How DuckDuckGo Makes Money . Outside of these clearly labelled ads, DuckDuckGo does not accept compensation to influence search result rankings. We also provide information about advertising on DuckDuckGo through our Help Page on Advertise on DuckDuckGo Search . AI-Assisted Answers DuckDuckGo generates AI-assisted answers to search queries by anonymously summarizing web content. To generate AI-assisted answers, Web sources are primarily selected based on relevancy to the query in a neutral manner. When selecting Web sources, we do not take into account the particular political bias or leanings of sources. We also do not prioritize our own products and services or accept compensation to influence the sources we cite. Like all search engines, we try to avoid egregious spam in our sources, and in the rare situation that DuckDuckGo avoids a particular source, you may request further information by contacting legal@duckduckgo.com . Duck.ai In line with how our AI-assisted answers ranking works, web sources within Duck.ai are selected based primarily on their relevancy to the prompt and sources are selected in a neutral manner, without taking into account their particular political bias or leanings. We also do not prioritize our own products and services or accept compensation to influence the sources we cite.

But it’s a myth that creepy tracking is a necessary trade-off. DuckDuckGo does everything you’d expect of a browser and search engine — while still helping to protect your personal information. At DuckDuckGo, we believe the best way to protect your personal information from hackers, scammers, and privacy-invasive companies is to stop it from being collected at all. That's why millions of people choose DuckDuckGo over Chrome and other browsers to search and browse online. Our built-in search engine is like Google but never tracks your searches. And our browsing protections, such as ad tracker blocking and cookie blocking, help stop other companies from collecting your data. Oh, and our browser is free — we make money from privacy-respecting search ads , not by exploiting your data. Take back control of your personal information with the browser designed for data protection, not data collection. Nothing bad about that.

Not at this time, but we are considering this possibility for the future. Why do I hit a usage limit immediately after starting a conversation? Due to the way we anonymously enforce usage limits, you may see this error message when using a VPN or cellular network. Try switching VPN locations or switching from a cellular network to WiFi, and see if that resolves the issue. If the issue persists, please use the Share Feedback button at the bottom of the chat page to report it. Is the method to impose these limits private? Yes. Per our strict Privacy Policy , “We don’t save your IP address or any unique identifiers alongside your searches or visits to our websites. We also never log IP addresses or any unique identifiers to disk.” The same applies to Duck.ai chats. To impose usage limits, we use a similar method as we do in search to prevent abuse. While we cannot divulge the exact method in order to protect our system from bad actors and misuse, it is engineered in such a way that makes it completely anonymous.

Duck.ai does not record or store any of your chats, and your conversations are not used to train chat models by DuckDuckGo or the underlying model providers (for example, Open AI and Anthropic). All metadata that contains personal information (for example, your IP address) is completely removed before prompting the model provider. This means chats to Anthropic, OpenAI, and together.ai (which hosts Meta Llama 3.3 and Mixtral on their servers) appear as though they are coming from DuckDuckGo rather than individual users. This also means if you submit personal information in your chats, no one, including DuckDuckGo and the model providers, can tell whether it was you personally submitting the prompts or someone else. In addition, we have agreements in place with all model providers that further limit how they can use data from these anonymous chats, including the requirement that they delete all information received once it is no longer necessary to provide responses (at most within 30 days with limited exceptions for safety and legal compliance).

    "content": "Duck.ai What is DuckDuckGo’s approach to AI? At DuckDuckGo, we believe the best way to protect your personal information from hackers, scammers, and privacy-invasive companies is to stop it from being collected at all. Our search engine doesn’t collect your search history; our browser offers a suite of built-in protections like ad tracker blocking and cookie blocking; and our optional Privacy Pro subscription includes a VPN that prevents websites from collecting your IP address. Our approach to AI extends this strategy by integrating private, useful, and optional AI features that don’t track how you use them or train on your data. We’re not making AI features just for the sake of it. We believe our AI features will help people get faster, high-quality answers to their questions. However, we recognize not everyone wants AI in their lives right now, which is why all our AI features are optional and can be turned off or tuned down from your search and browser settings. We currently have two AI features. Duck.ai offers free access to popular chatbots, anonymized by us. AI-assisted answers , previously called DuckAssist, are sourced from the web and appear alongside our traditional search results. AI-assisted answers appear in search results for relevant English-language queries, with prominent links to sources for more information. If you opt to show them “often,” AI-assisted answers should appear in over 20% of search results. AI-assisted answers also include a link to Duck.ai, where you can ask follow-up questions. Both Duck.ai and AI-assisted answers are free to use and anonymized by us, with no account required. Learn More What AI chat models are available? How does Duck.ai protect my privacy?

    "content": "DuckDuckGo Help Pages About Duck Player Duck Player is a free YouTube player built in to the DuckDuckGo browser for Mac , Windows , iOS and Android that lets you watch YouTube without targeted ads and keeps what you watch from influencing your YouTube recommendations.‌‌ How does Duck Player work? The browser’s built-in video player protects you from tracking cookies and personalized ads by enforcing YouTube’s strictest privacy settings for embedded video, all within a clean, theater-like interface. In our testing, Duck Player prevented ads from loading on most videos altogether. When watching with Duck Player, YouTube can still log video views, so it’s not completely anonymous, but your viewing history does not contribute to your personalized recommendations or your YouTube advertising profile. How do I use Duck Player? All you need to do is download DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser for Mac , Windows , iOS or Android and turn on Duck Player in Settings. You can choose to always open YouTube videos in Duck Player, never use Duck Player, or make it optional – perfect for when you’re sharing your screen, using a shared device, or just trying to stay focused. It’s equally easy to get back to the default version of YouTube whenever you want. © 2025 DuckDuckGo Search X Reddit About DuckDuckGo"

    "content": "Privacy Pro / Personal Information Removal What does the ‘allow traffic to bypass the VPN’ setting do? As explained in Personal Information Removal Privacy , DuckDuckGo submits removal requests to data broker sites on your behalf directly from your device. These data broker sites may try to block these automated removal requests if they appear to be coming from a VPN. By allowing Personal Information Removal traffic to bypass the DuckDuckGo VPN , you can ensure that more of your records get removed while still enjoying VPN protection across the rest of your device. In addition, Personal Information Removal traffic is isolated from other browser activity on your computer, and no data from that traffic will persist on your device after the scan is complete. Is Personal Information Removal traffic still hidden from my ISP if it bypasses the VPN? Yes. When the VPN is on, automated scans and removal requests from Personal Information Removal are still hidden from your Internet service provider even when “allow traffic to bypass the VPN” is on. That’s because we still route DNS queries for data broker sites through the VPN, sending them through our own DNS resolver instead of your ISP, which adds an additional privacy layer to the VPN.

    "content": "Privacy Pro / Personal Information Removal Why hasn’t Personal Information Removal removed a record it found? When a record is found on a data broker site, Personal Information Removal will usually submit a removal request to the site within 24 hours. Once the request has been submitted, most sites will remove the record within 10 days, though some sites are known to take much longer. If a record has still not been removed 4 weeks after the removal request was sent, we consider it to be overdue. The reasons for a record not being removed will vary from site to site, but some sites appear to have unreliable processes for actioning removal requests. Possible reasons for overdue removals include: The removal request is still pending and will be processed eventually. The removal request was ignored by the data broker. The record was removed, but quickly re-added before Personal Information Removal detected the removal. What can I do to make sure an overdue record is removed? When a record becomes overdue, Personal Information Removal will continue to monitor the record and check to see if it has been removed every few days. Overdue records are usually removed eventually, but in some cases the site may not honor the original removal request. You can try submitting a removal request yourself, which sometimes will prompt sites to speed up removal. The links below will take you directly to the instructions on how to do this for each site supported by Personal Information Removal.

    "content": "Privacy Pro / Personal Information Removal About the DuckDuckGo Personal Information Removal Process How long does it take for my info to be removed from data broker sites? The time it takes to remove your information varies from site to site. Some sites process removal requests within 24 hours, while others can take up to 6 weeks. Most removal requests just take a few days. Once Personal Information Removal finds your info on a site, it begins the removal process immediately. Do I need to leave the browser running while a scan is in progress? While scans and removals are performed from your device, the browser does not need to be open for these processes to run. Once you have Personal Information Removal set up, everything runs in the background. Are there sites my personal information won’t be removed from? Personal Information Removal is focused on the largest data brokers and people-search sites. You can review the list of sites we currently remove information from here . We cannot remove personal information from other places online such as social media sites, sources of public record (birth, marriage, divorce, death), government databases, PPP loan databases, news articles, voter records, property records, or image databases. We also, unfortunately, cannot remove data from brokers who refuse to comply with opt-out requests. Why does my personal information still turn up in search results? Personal Information Removal targets data brokers and people-search sites, but your information may exist on other sites that can still appear in search results. Search engines may also still show your information on cached data broker site results until it crawls the updated site again. The timing with which different search engines update their results varies but, over time, Personal Information Removal should reduce how much of your information turns up in search results overall but cannot completely prevent it from reappearing over time. Can my personal info reappear on people-search sites after removal? Yes, personal info can reappear on people-search sites if it’s collected from new sources. We re-scan sites regularly to ensure your information is promptly removed if it appears again. I have a question not covered here, how can I get help?

DuckDuckGo Personal Information Removal can help find and remove your personal information, such as your name and address, from data broker sites that store and sell it, helping to combat identity theft and spam. Access to Personal Information Removal comes with DuckDuckGo Privacy Pro subscriptions in the U.S . At this time, Personal Information Removal is designed to be set up and run only on one desktop device. How do I get Personal Information Removal? DuckDuckGo Personal Information Removal is included in the DuckDuckGo Privacy Pro subscription for US residents . To subscribe to Privacy Pro and use Personal Information Removal, first download the DuckDuckGo Browser on desktop and subscribe to Privacy Pro in the browser settings. Once you’ve subscribed, you’ll be able to start using Personal Information Removal from the Settings menu in the browser. How does Personal Information Removal work? When you use Personal Information Removal for the first time, the app will ask for your name, age, and address. This data is stored locally on your device and never shared with DuckDuckGo. Once you've provided this information, Personal Information Removal automates the removal process. It scans for your info on over 50 data broker sites, requests its removal, and receives and handles confirmation emails for you. It then scans these sites on a regular schedule to minimize the risk of your information reappearing. Unlike other services, every step of this process happens entirely on your device, not remote servers — your device stores the personal information you provide during setup and initiates removal requests. After Personal Information Removal conducts its initial scan, you track the progress of ongoing removals, keep tabs on the total number of records that have been removed, and see the site-scanning schedule on your personal dashboard in the DuckDuckGo browser. What are data brokers, and how did they get my data? Data brokers collect and sell personal data, which they aggregate from public records, Internet trackers, and other sources. This information may include your name, physical address, birth date, the names of your relatives, and more. Many of these sites will display some amount of your personal information for free to anyone who searches for your name. Can you remove personal information for a family member? Currently, Personal Information Removal is only intended for use by the individual who subscribed to Privacy Pro. Each person who wants to remove their own personal information would need to purchase their own Privacy Pro subscription. Is Personal Information Removal available outside the U.S.? Personal Information Removal is only available in the U.S. where data collection is a pervasive issue. In the E.U. and many other regions, regulations like GDPR prevent data brokers from collecting and selling personal information without consent in the first place.

    "content": "Privacy Pro / VPN DuckDuckGo VPN Troubleshooting The VPN will automatically attempt to reconnect or switch servers if it fails. While the VPN is attempting to reconnect, it will block all Internet traffic temporarily to prevent accidental data leaks until the VPN connection is restored. Why do I experience slower internet speeds? As with any VPN, Internet speeds will decrease slightly because your device traffic must go through the extra step of traveling through an external VPN server before accessing the internet and returning to your device. However, the DuckDuckGo VPN is designed to minimize any impact on Internet speed. Do you limit speed, bandwidth, or data volume? DuckDuckGo VPN does not have any set speed or bandwidth limits or caps, although we reserve the right to impose such limits, for example to prevent abuse or network errors. For more information, please see our Privacy Pro Terms of Service . How do I access my printer or other local devices? By default, local networks are excluded from the VPN on Android, iOS, and Mac to allow you to access your printer, smart home devices, and other local devices normally without adjusting any settings. We plan to similarly exclude local networks on Windows soon. Until then, you can disable the VPN temporarily to access your printer and other local devices. Why do some sites or apps not work? Some site or app developers may block VPN traffic. If a site or app is failing to load, try turning the VPN off before reloading the site or app. If that fixes the issue, you may need to temporarily turn off the VPN when accessing that site or app. If you continue to experience issues with a site or app while the VPN is on, you may be able to exclude that site or app from the VPN, depending on the platform. To exclude apps from the VPN on Android, open the DuckDuckGo browser and tap on the three dot icon, then go to Settings > VPN > Excluded Apps . There, you can scroll through a list of all installed apps on your device and disable VPN protections for any apps that you want to exclude from the VPN. We plan to eventually introduce similar exclusion features on iOS, Mac, and Windows. Will I need to update firewall settings to use the VPN? No. I have a question not covered here, how can I get help? Please contact support at privacypro@duckduckgo.com .

    "title": "DuckDuckGo VPN DNS Blocklists - DuckDuckGo Help Pages",
    "content": "Privacy Pro / VPN DuckDuckGo VPN DNS Blocklists The DuckDuckGo VPN is pre-configured to use DuckDuckGo's domain name system (DNS) servers to convert the website names you type or navigate to (such as duckduckgo.com ) into the IP addresses your device needs to find those sites. This helps protect your Internet traffic from being logged or monetized by your Internet service provider (ISP) or other third-party DNS providers. If you prefer to use a third-party DNS service instead, you can configure a custom DNS service under VPN Settings > DNS Server . DuckDuckGo's DNS servers also use what’s called a DNS blocklist to help you avoid accidentally accessing harmful sites that might put your personal information at risk. These include sites that host malware, phishing attacks, and online scams. How does the DuckDuckGo DNS blocklist work? When you try to access a website, your device performs a DNS query to translate the website name into an IP address. When the DuckDuckGo VPN is connected, these DNS queries will be sent to a DuckDuckGo DNS server. When the DuckDuckGo DNS server receives a DNS query, it will first check the requested website name against a blocklist we update regularly. If the website name is on the blocklist, the DNS server will not return the website's IP address, and your browser will display an error message. If you're using the DuckDuckGo browser, you would see a message explaining that DuckDuckGo can't load the page. Other browsers handle blocked DNS queries differently and may display a different error when a website is blocked by our VPN. How is the DuckDuckGo DNS blocklist created and updated? The list of harmful domains is provided to us by our partner, Netcraft . The blocklist currently contains over 150,000 sites and is updated daily. Can I disable or customize the DuckDuckGo DNS blocklist? You can disable the DNS blocklist by turning off “Block risky domains” under VPN Settings > DNS Server . If you disable the blocklist, DNS queries will continue to use a DuckDuckGo DNS server, but none of your DNS queries will be checked against the blocklist or blocked. The DuckDuckGo DNS blocklist cannot be customized or modified at this time. However, if you would prefer to use a third-party DNS service that better fits your preferences, you can configure the DuckDuckGo VPN to use a custom DNS service under VPN Settings > DNS Server . A site was wrongfully blocked. How can I report it? If you believe a website was incorrectly blocked by the DuckDuckGo VPN, you can report it to us at privacypro@duckduckgo.com . You can also use the “Share Feedback” option found in the DuckDuckGo browser menu. Learn More What is DuckDuckGo VPN? Does DuckDuckGo VPN store any log of my VPN activity?

    "content": "Privacy Pro / VPN What is DuckDuckGo VPN? DuckDuckGo VPN (short for Virtual Private Network) is a service that gives you an extra layer of protection online by encrypting your Internet connection across your entire device and hiding your location and IP address from the sites you visit. It’s built for speed and simplicity. How can I use the VPN? DuckDuckGo VPN is included in the DuckDuckGo Privacy Pro subscription . To subscribe to Privacy Pro and use our VPN, first download the DuckDuckGo Browser on mobile or desktop and subscribe to Privacy Pro in the browser’s settings. Once you’ve subscribed, you’ll be able to install and manage the VPN from the settings menu in the browser. How does the VPN work? Enabling the DuckDuckGo VPN establishes a secure, encrypted connection (VPN tunnel) between your device and one of our VPN servers. For all your device's network traffic that passes through this tunnel, the VPN prevents others, such as your Internet service provider, from seeing this activity. It also prevents your Internet destinations, like websites, from seeing your device’s IP address. Is all network traffic protected or only web browsing? The VPN protects Internet connections across your full device, not just your web browsing activity. If the VPN experiences an interruption, all internet traffic will automatically be blocked until the VPN either reconnects or you turn off the VPN. Why use DuckDuckGo VPN over others? Unlike many other VPNs, our VPN is private with a strict no-logging policy. It is also easy to use; there’s no need to install a separate app and, using the DuckDuckGo browser, you can connect in just one click. Our VPN offers full device coverage on up to 5 devices at once and is fast and reliable, with servers across the US, Canada, and Europe. DuckDuckGo VPN is also the only VPN that works with DuckDuckGo App Tracking Protection on Android devices. Are there countries where I can’t use the DuckDuckGo VPN? If you’re a Privacy Pro subscriber traveling outside of your home country, you can use the VPN anywhere it is legal to do so. I have a question not covered here, how can I get help?

What is a one-time passphrase and how do I use it? Instead of using a traditional password, DuckDuckGo Privacy Pro uses one-time passphrases (OTPs) as an option for activating your subscription. If you have added an email address to your subscription, you can use it to activate Privacy Pro on a new device or restore your purchase. We’ll send you an email with a one-time passphrase that you’ll need to enter in the same browser you’re trying to activate from. If you’re having issues activating your device, please make sure that you’re pasting the code within the time limit stated in the email, and that you’re requesting and entering the one-time passphrase in the same browser. What if I did not receive the one-time passphrase email to access my subscription? If you did not receive the one-time passphrase email to activate your DuckDuckGo Privacy Pro subscription on a new device, please first confirm that you have added an email address to your subscription. This can be checked with the following steps. On iOS or Android: Open the DuckDuckGo browser, tap the three-dot icon to open the browser menu and go to Settings .

    "content": "App Tracking Protection Is App Tracking Protection a VPN? App Tracking Protection is a feature in the DuckDuckGo Private Browser for Android that helps block 3rd-party trackers in your apps, even when you’re not using them. Though similar, App Tracking Protection is different from a VPN. App Tracking Protection works locally on your device, sitting between your apps and the servers they talk to. When App Tracking Protection recognizes a tracker on our list of app trackers , it blocks the tracker from sending personal information (such as your IP address, activity, and device details) off your device. All other traffic reaches its destination, so your apps work normally. A VPN is different. It works by establishing a secure, encrypted connection (VPN tunnel) between your device and one of its servers. All device network traffic that passes through this tunnel is anonymized and hidden from your Internet service provider and other websites you visit. The DuckDuckGo VPN works in the same way, and secures your connection across your entire device, including your apps and browsers, on up to five devices at once. Plus, it has a strict no-logging policy, and you can connect in just a click, directly from the DuckDuckGo browser. Learn more Is my data private? Yes. As explained above, App Tracking Protection just works on your device and doesn’t send your personal data off your device to DuckDuckGo or other companies. If not a VPN, then why does App Tracking Protection use a VPN connection? You will be asked to set up a virtual private network (VPN) connection, but you don’t need to install a VPN app for App Tracking Protection to work. This permission allows App Tracking Protection, which just works locally on your device, to monitor network traffic so that it can block trackers on our list. Will App Tracking Protection work if I also use a VPN app? App Tracking Protection is only compatible with the DuckDuckGo VPN. Because Android only allows one active VPN connection per device, App Tracking Protection won’t work with other VPNs. However, the DuckDuckGo VPN can share the same VPN connection because both features are managed by the DuckDuckGo browser. If using a different VPN, we recommend that you enable App Tracking Protection when you are not using other VPNs. Just make sure your VPN app isn’t set to “Always-on.” Go to Android Network settings > VPN. Then, check the gear icon for any listed VPN apps and disable “Always-on.” Some VPN apps may also have an auto-connect setting which must be disabled.

    "content": "App Tracking Protection Does App Tracking Protection block trackers in all my apps? App Tracking Protection is a feature in the DuckDuckGo Private Browser for Android that helps block 3rd-party trackers in your apps, even when you’re not using them. We aim to protect your privacy as much as possible, but no service can eliminate all hidden app tracking or profiling. To be effective, App Tracking Protection needs to continually evolve to mitigate how trackers attempt to evade us without disrupting essential usability. Some apps depend on code delivered by 3rd-party trackers to function and blocking these trackers can cause apps to behave unexpectedly. To preserve essential usability, we may make limited exceptions and automatically disable protection for individual apps. For example, we automatically disable protection for browsers and other apps that load websites so content appears normally. In other cases, we can preserve essential usability by making limited exceptions for individual trackers while leaving protection enabled for apps. For example, if blocking a certain 3rd-party tracker in a mobile game prevented players from receiving in-game rewards, we may make a limited exception for that tracker within the game app, while continuing to block the tracker in other apps. We also don’t block trackers belonging to an app’s parent company (known as 1st-party trackers) because doing so would likely cause the app to behave unexpectedly. This means that protection may be automatically disabled for apps like those installed by default on your Android device. If you think App Tracking Protection might be causing usability issues in one of your apps, you can manually disable protection for apps in Settings > App Tracking Protection > Manage > View Apps and report the issue you experienced to us. We review user-reported app issues daily, and work to address them continuously by updating our open source list of app trackers and exceptions like those described above to preserve usability.

    "content": "Sync & Backup How secure is DuckDuckGo’s built-in password manager? DuckDuckGo’s password manager has a range of robust security protections in place to keep your passwords safe and accessible only by you. On-device encryption & storage Locks access behind secure on-device authentication Lets you generate secure passwords on the fly Phishing protection for autofill Sync & Backup is easy to set up when you’re ready On-Device Encryption & Storage Unlike other browsers and password managers, you won’t have to set up another account to remember or autofill passwords in DuckDuckGo. That’s because we don’t store your passwords in the cloud by default — we encrypt them (via 256-bit AES) before stashing them securely on your device. Biometric or Passcode Unlock We designed our password manager to leverage the security built-in to your Apple, Windows, and Android devices. Your saved passwords can only be accessed or used after authenticating with built-in biometric security, for example Face ID or Touch ID, or your passcode. Secure Password Generation Using the same password for different sites makes that password less secure, and remembering unique passwords for all your sites can be a pain. The DuckDuckGo password manager gives you one-touch access to a strong random password whenever you sign up to a new site, which you can easily access whenever you sign back in. Phishing Protection Once you’ve saved a login for a website, we won’t show you an autofill prompt unless that domain’s signature matches one of your saved passwords. If you’ve saved a password, autofill prompts won’t appear for sign-in forms on sites pretending to be the real website, and we’ll never pre-fill your saved passwords without prompting you first — if something about the site seems dodgy you can choose not to proceed. End-To-End Encrypted Sync & Backup If you set up private Sync & Backup in DuckDuckGo, we store your data on our servers in a way that prevents us and others from reading it but lets you access up-to-date logins in DuckDuckGo browsers on your other devices. End-to-end encryption means your data is encrypted before it’s uploaded to DuckDuckGo’s servers and is only decrypted after it’s downloaded onto your device. In other words, it’s encrypted from one end (the first device) to the other end (a second device) and is only readable from your devices that contain the encryption key. That means DuckDuckGo does not have access to the encryption key and cannot read the data stored on our servers.

    "content": "Sync & Backup Learn About DuckDuckGo Sync Recovery Codes & Troubleshooting Tips What is the Recovery Code? Why do I need it? Your Recovery Code is the only way to recover your synced data if you lose access to all the devices on which you have enabled DuckDuckGo Sync & Backup. It provides full, unencrypted access to all your data — so, first and foremost, make sure to keep the Recovery Code private and do not share it with anyone. While setting up Sync & Backup, you will be encouraged to save your Recovery Code. Copy and paste the code into a safe place, such as a password manager, and/or download a recovery PDF which includes both a QR code and the full Recovery Code text. Why is it beneficial to setup Sync & Backup on more than one device? Setting up Sync & Backup on more than one device makes your bookmarks and passwords easily accessible on each of your devices. If one of your devices is lost or damaged, or if you’re setting up a new device, you can use the second device to recover previously synced data on your replacement device. If I lose my device, how can I recover my data? To recover your data, you’ll either need your Recovery Code or another device with Sync & Backup already enabled. To recover your data using the Recovery Code: Open the DuckDuckGo browser Go to Settings > Sync & Backup Select Recover Synced Data Follow the on-screen instructions, then either: Scan the QR code Enter the alphanumeric code from your recovery PDF To recover your data using a second device, follow the steps outlined in Syncing New Devices to add the new device to Sync & Backup. I lost my device, lost my Recovery Code, and do not have Sync & Backup currently enabled on any of my other devices. Is there any way to recover my data? No, unfortunately not – that’s why it’s important to keep your Recovery Code in a safe place, and/or use Sync & Backup on multiple devices. Because Sync & Backup is end-to-end encrypted, DuckDuckGo does not have your Recovery Code and cannot provide access to your data in this scenario.

    "content": "Sync & Backup How To Sync Favorites & Bookmark Icons Across Devices in DuckDuckGo How are favorites different than bookmarks? The DuckDuckGo browser lets you mark certain bookmarks as a “favorites.” For quick access, favorited bookmarks are displayed in convenient locations, such as the New Tab page. Marking a bookmark as a favorite on one device type will not result in it being marked as a favorite on other devices by default, even if you’ve turned on Sync & Backup. Can I keep the same favorites across all my devices? Yes, you can! If you want the same favorites displayed across all your devices, do this after you enable Sync & Backup: Open the DuckDuckGo browser Go to Settings > Sync & Backup Turn on the Unify Favorites Across Devices setting You only need to turn on this setting on one of your devices to sync favorites across all of them If you want to keep your mobile and desktop favorites separate, leave this setting off. I'd like my bookmarks and favorites to show the website’s icon, instead of placeholder letters. How can I get icons to show up for my synced bookmarks? Automatically downloading website icons (favicons) for synced bookmarks has privacy implications to consider, so this feature is available on an opt-in basis. To turn it on: Open the DuckDuckGo browser Go to Settings > Sync & Backup Turn on the Auto-Download Icons setting You will need to do this separately for each synced device. Please note that downloading bookmark icons from the web will expose knowledge of your bookmarks to your network, even if you don't visit the bookmark while connected to that network. Consider leaving this setting off if you connect to sensitive or shared networks (e.g., work, school, etc.) and do not want those networks to see your bookmarks.

That encrypted data is uploaded to DuckDuckGo’s servers so it can stay in sync with your other devices. (Synced data can also be restored with your Recovery Code if you lose your device.) At no time can DuckDuckGo decrypt or access your data. What does it mean to be end-to-end encrypted? When you enable Sync & Backup, a unique encryption key is generated locally on your device. A copy of this encryption key is saved on any other devices that you sync. It’s also stored within your Recovery Code, in case your devices are lost or damaged. End-to-end encryption means that your data is encrypted before it is uploaded to DuckDuckGo’s servers, and it’s only decrypted after it’s downloaded onto your other devices. In other words, it’s encrypted from one end (the first device) to the other end (a second device) and is only readable in plain text from your devices that contain the encryption key. DuckDuckGo does not have access to the encryption key and cannot read the data stored on our servers. Even if someone were to breach our servers and gain access to your data, it would remain encrypted, and they wouldn't be able to read it without your encryption key. What specific data will be synced? Sync & Backup covers your bookmarks, passwords, and your Email Protection account. We expect to add more types of data over time. Can I sync and back up only my bookmarks but not my passwords, or vice versa? Currently, Sync & Backup is an all-or-nothing feature. In the future, we expect to add the ability to sync certain data types but not others. Is there a limit to the amount of data that I can sync? Yes, but it is a very high limit meant only to prevent abuse. We don’t expect anyone to hit this limit with regular usage.

    "title": "Phishing and Malware Protection in DuckDuckGo Browsers - DuckDuckGo Help Pages",
    "content": "Web Browsing Privacy Phishing and Malware Protection in DuckDuckGo Browsers The DuckDuckGo browser’s phishing and malware protection helps keep you safe while browsing online. Other browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari rely on Google’s Safe Browsing Service to provide these phishing warnings, which involves sending information to Google. We don’t. We built our own anonymous solution that doesn’t send data to any third parties. Why is phishing and malware protection necessary? Phishing and malware are two of the most common online security threats. Cybercriminals use phishing to trick people into giving them personal information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers. They also try to get people to download malware that can infect phones or computers to cause damage or extract personal information. Phishing and malware protection is designed to alert you to sites that have been flagged for making phishing attempts or hosting malware. You can disable this feature in the DuckDuckGo browser settings menu. How does phishing and malware protection work anonymously in DuckDuckGo browsers? To start, your browser needs to know which websites have been flagged for phishing or malware. This list of sites is provided to us by our partner, Netcraft , and we store the list on our servers. Your browser downloads a version of this list from DuckDuckGo so it’s available locally on your device. When you navigate to a site, your browser first checks the site against the list stored on your device. If the site is on the list, your browser shows a warning message that gives you the option to navigate away safely or to continue to the site at your own risk. For uncommon threats, an extra, anonymous verification step that checks websites against a larger and more comprehensive database on DuckDuckGo servers is needed (as explained below); however, this process is also anonymous and at no time does your device communicate with any other third parties as part of the threat verification process. Here’s how it works technically: Initial List Setup Periodically, the browser receives a list of known malicious websites from a DuckDuckGo server. This list isn’t human readable. Instead, each domain is represented by the first 8 characters of its SHA256 hash, also known as a “hash prefix.”- If you were to look at this list, you’d see something like [d4c9d902, 133066d1, ...] instead of [website1, website2, ...] For details on how hashes work, see Hash Function and SHA-2 . The DuckDuckGo server also provides a detailed list of the most common threats, sorted by their similarity to commonly visited sites. For example, [{\"regex\": \"(?i)^https?\\\\:\\\\/\\\\/bad-third-party\\\\.site(?:\\\\:(?:80|443))?\\\\/security\\\\/badware\\\\/phishing\\\\.html$\", \"hash\": \"e4753ddad954dafd4ff4ef67f82b3c1a2db6ef4a51bda43513260170e558bd13\"}, ...] Local Threat Detection When you navigate around the web, your browser generates the SHA256 hash of domains you’re about to visit and checks them against the SHA256 hashes in the list of known malicious sites and against the list of common threats. If the site matches any entry in both lists, the browser warns you about the potential danger. Most of the time this on-device threat verification process is sufficient to determine if the site is dangerous. Handling Uncommon Threats If your browser can’t find the domain you’re about to visit in the list of common threats but does find a match in the hash prefixes of known malicious sites, further verification against a larger and more comprehensive dataset is needed to ensure the site in question is known to be malicious. In these cases, the browser sends the first 4 characters of the domain’s SHA256 hash to DuckDuckGo servers for further verification.- The extra step to generate a 4-character hash prefix ensures your browsing history can’t be tied back to you. In fact, we chose a 4-character hash prefix because it represents up to 65,536 values, and with hundreds of millions of potential domains online, many will share the same 4-character prefix, making it virtually impossible to associate any hash sent to DuckDuckGo with any specific domain. This request data is never logged or stored anywhere on our servers and is only used to return matching data from DuckDuckGo’s database. The DuckDuckGo server responds by sending a refined list of possible matches back to the browser. Your browser can then compare the URL you’re about to visit against this new list of known malicious sites and make a final decision based on information received. To be clear, this means that your searches and browsing history are still completely anonymous.

This technology is used to control playback of copyrighted content. We assess the privacy and usability implications of supporting features in our browsers, including DRM. In the DuckDuckGo browser for Android, DRM permissions are only available for websites that use Widevine , which is one of the most popular industry standards, but is also known to provide access to device identifiers on Android. Over time, we'll investigate the privacy risks and protection for DRM on other platforms, as well as other DRM providers. If you see the following permission prompt on a website and click “Allow” in a DuckDuckGo browser, this allows the website to access the DRM technology provided by your device. When should you allow DRM permissions?

In order to provide additional protection for situations where the websites otherwise sell or share your data with other companies that may profit or benefit from it (such as selling data to advertisers or data brokers after your visit), we helped pioneer the Global Privacy Control (GPC) standard. GPC is a browser or device setting that, when enabled, signals to websites you visit a preference for privacy. It's easy to use GPC with DuckDuckGo – simply install the DuckDuckGo Private Browser or the DuckDuckGo Search & Tracker Protection browser extension . The GPC setting is enabled by default so you don't need to do anything else! In this post-Snowden, post-Cambridge Analytica era, the many harms caused by behavioral profiling and other privacy invasions have led to the introduction of regulations such as CCPA (the California Consumer Privacy Act) in California and the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in the European Union. By invoking specific rights under these regulations, GPC is an effective way to add another layer of privacy protection to your online activities. In California under CCPA, GPC is intended to be an opt out of the \"sale\" of your personal information. (See Section 1798.140(ad) of the CCPA for legal details but, broadly, \"sale\" here includes more than strictly buying and selling, such as transferring data for value other than money.) In the EU under GDPR, for participating websites, GPC is intended to convey that you object to the website sharing your personal information to other third parties for their own marketing other than on behalf of the website you are visiting. Depending on the jurisdiction and applicable laws, you may have different rights when the GPC signal is sent to websites you visit. Be aware that this is not intended to give effect to all privacy rights you may have under applicable law. As a simple notification working in the background, GPC works invisibly and is designed not to interfere with your browsing or use of other software. In some cases, GPC is disabled to prevent a site from breaking or otherwise not functioning as expected. For a complete list of sites where the GPC signal is not sent due to breakage, click here . GPC also doesn't replace or interfere with other privacy-protecting measures such as tracker blocking and encryption, which are also included in the DuckDuckGo browsers and browser extensions. If you'd like further information, such as how the standard is being further developed, or how your website or tool can implement it, please visit the Global Privacy Control website , or get in touch directly at info@globalprivacycontrol.org .

    "content": "Web Browsing Privacy DuckDuckGo Embedded Social Media Protection When you visit a website that contains embedded content from social media sites (such as videos, posts, comments, or login buttons), that content often includes tracking code that those social media companies can use to link your user or device information (e.g., your IP address and browser details) with your browsing history. In some cases, like with Facebook, this can happen regardless of whether you have an account or not . Embedded content from social media companies can detect and store your browsing activity and use it to target content and ads to you, even if the page you're on is not related to that social media service. Sometimes you might want to load the embedded content despite the privacy risks, such as when you're playing a social game linked with your Facebook account. Most times, though, you'd likely prefer to keep your browsing activity private instead. When you use our app or browser extension , DuckDuckGo's Embedded Social Media Protection blocks embedded content from Facebook on supported platforms . Over time, we'll also be blocking similar embedded content from more companies. If you decide to unblock the content, this could load the content's tracking code too. While companies will receive some user information each time you unblock content, this protection will help to reduce what they know about you overall. Signing in to a website through a social media account also unblocks embedded content from that social media company automatically. This means that social media companies can see your activity on sites where you've signed in via their login form, the same as if you chose to unblock embedded content. All other DuckDuckGo Web Tracking Protections (such as 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection on websites you visit) remain active. How to Disable this Protection You can disable Embedded Social Media Protection for any website by following these instructions: Click the DuckDuckGo Search & Tracker Protection extension icon in your toolbar. Toggle Protections OFF. The page will be added to your list of Unprotected Sites , which you can manage anytime from Settings .

For example, we do not create unique cookies and, more generally, architect our product so that we do not even have the ability to create a search or browsing history for any individual — it’s privacy by design. We believe getting the privacy you deserve should be as easy as closing the blinds, and we make privacy protection tools to help you seamlessly control your personal information online. These tools include the DuckDuckGo Search & Tracker Protection browser extension for Firefox and Chrome, as well as the DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser app for iOS and Android. They each contain several leading privacy technologies we've developed to reduce your digital footprint, such as DuckDuckGo Search, Tracker Blocking, and Smarter Encryption. This explanation is about our Smarter Encryption technology, and in particular network requests you may notice going to smarter_encryption.js from our apps and extensions. This technology is used to determine if a website can be upgraded to an encrypted version, both without breaking your browsing experience and completely protecting your privacy. With Smarter Encryption, your browsing will use encrypted connections more often. That means fewer prying eyes on your browsing history, like from your Internet provider or wi-fi snoopers. The way it works is we continually maintain a list of sites that support encryption. When you try to go to an unencrypted site that we know supports encryption (i.e. is on our list), we first automatically upgrade your connection to use the encrypted version of the website. It's seamless! Our Smarter Encryption list is quite large: over 10 million sites and growing. Due to this large size, the list cannot be fully stored in the apps or extensions installed on your devices. Instead, we store the most trafficked sites locally on your devices, and keep the rest of the list on our servers. Here's how it works: You click or navigate to an insecure (http) domain such as http://spreadprivacy.com The spreadprivacy.com domain would first be looked up in your local list (the one on the device with the most trafficked sites) to see if it can be upgraded immediately. If not, it will be converted to a SHA-1 hash: 194a8d7aa538455b8c3a2ff68dcd3a4c5d80743a (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function & https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1 for more details on how that conversion works) The first four characters of this hash ( 194a ) are sent to our anonymous smarter_encryption.js service. Our logs never contain IP addresses or other personal information, so just like anonymous queries on DuckDuckGo Search , we do not know anything about who is making these requests. Only you and your device know. Nevertheless, we added another layer of privacy protection to this anonymous service by only having your device send the first four characters of the hashed domain, such that in any case the service cannot tell what exact domain you are visiting. The anonymous service sends back any hashed domains from the full Smarter Encryption list that match the first four characters of the hash sent (e.g. https://duckduckgo.com/smarter_encryption.js?pv1=194a ). It's possible that it will send back nothing (if nothing matches). Your device looks through the returned hashed domains to see if the hash of the domain you are visiting exactly matches one of hashed domains returned. If so, it is upgraded! To be clear, this means that your searches and browsing history are still completely anonymous.

To improve our service, we develop completely anonymous ways to understand how people discover and use our products.

These parameters allow us to anonymously see where a browser download originated by assigning a string of text to indicate the download source. For example, the parameter might indicate that the download happened from a button on our homepage or from a specific paid ad campaign. These strings are anonymous as they are not unique to individuals and are also not associated with any individual identifiers, for example IP address. Most of the time we use origin= to count each download and then discard it immediately.

And when you leave our search engine and use our apps or extensions to browse other sites, we aim to protect your privacy as much as possible. To be effective, browser tracking protection needs to continually evolve to mitigate how trackers attempt to evade specific protections. That’s why we offer multiple types of web tracking protections. Other browsers offer some of these by default, like cookie and fingerprinting protections, but we also provide many other protections that most browsers do not offer by default, like 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection , Global Privacy Control , Link Tracking Protection , CNAME Cloaking Protection , Google AMP Protection , and more, which all help cover different tracking angles. For example, most browsers’ default tracking protection focuses on cookie and fingerprinting protections that only restrict trackers after they load in your browser. Unfortunately, that level of protection leaves information like your IP address and other identifiers sent with loading requests vulnerable to profiling. We offer our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection to help address this vulnerability, which stops most 3rd-party trackers from loading in the first place, providing significantly more protection. We created this page to explain how each of our web tracking protections works, how our protections work across supported platforms, and how they work together to provide overlapping protection. Most of our apps and extensions are also open source , which means that anyone can examine their source code and how our web tracking protections are coded. To identify trackers, we crawl the web with our Tracker Radar , which is also open source , as is our list of trackers . While no one can eliminate all hidden tracking or all profiling online, we aim to prevent most 3rd-party tracking through the overlapping protections described on this page. At the same time, we aim to preserve site functionality as much as possible, for example making sure our Web Tracking Protections don’t interfere with your ability to view websites correctly, sign in to sites, or make online purchases. 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection When you visit a website, the web address (URL) in your browser’s address bar tells your browser where to go. What you may not realize, is that sites also try to load other URLs in the background while your destination page is loading. Many of those URLs come from other companies, commonly referred to as “3rd parties.” Sites often embed these 3rd-party requests to support site functionality, but they can also be used to track you. We crawl the web with Tracker Radar to identify tracking requests and maintain our own list of trackers . For example, the most prevalent 3rd-party tracker on the Internet is Google Analytics. Requests to Google Analytics URLs are embedded on millions of sites to help the owners understand how their sites are being used. But typically, Google can also use this to profile you outside of the site where the information originated. Most browsers that offer web tracking protections are usually talking about cookie tracking protections (described in 3rd-party and 1st-party cookie protection). However, these types of protections can only restrict 3rd-party trackers after they load in your browser, and these 3rd parties still get access to information that could be used to track you across sites as part of the loading process (like IP address or other identifiers sent with the loading request). To protect against this tracking, you need a web tracking protection that actually stops most 3rd-party tracking requests from loading in the first place. This type of protection comes built-in with all our apps and extensions, and goes well beyond the web tracking protections most popular browsers offer by default . This protection is particularly difficult to provide without causing usability issues because some websites depend on code that loads from these embedded requests. We can sometimes work around this with Surrogates . In other cases, we may make a limited exception when it would prevent you from signing in to a site or to otherwise preserve essential site functionality. It’s also important to note that the intention of 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection is not to stop all 3rd-party requests from loading, just those used for 3rd-party tracking. For example, infrastructure domains require more nuanced classification since they don’t always serve tracking content. Additionally 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection may also behave differently following a click on a DuckDuckGo Private Search Ad . Platform Support Firefox extension 3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from loading. Chrome extension 3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from loading.

Android app 3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from loading. Mac app 3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from loading. Windows app 3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from loading. 3rd-Party Cookie Protection Believe it or not, web “cookies” were originally designed to be a helpful data storage mechanism. However, 3rd-party cookies have become one of the most common methods of web tracking. If you notice the same ads following you around, 3rd-party cookies may be to blame because they can easily track you as you browse from site to site. That’s because even though third-party cookies are created on one site, they can be retrieved from another. For example, if you visit a website which uses Google’s ad network, it can create a 3rd-party cookie based on the content you are viewing. Then, when you visit another website that also uses Google ads, Google can read the initial cookie, know that you’re the same person, and show you an ad based on what you were viewing on the previous site. To protect against this, we first block most 3rd-party tracking requests with 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection , which stops requests from loading that would otherwise have a chance to create or access 3rd-party cookies. In addition, we also automatically block 3rd-party cookies on our list of known trackers by default, and will only make a limited exception when it would prevent you from signing in to a site or to otherwise preserve essential site functionality.

Windows app 3rd-party cookies from domains on our list blocked. 3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from setting or accessing 3rd-party cookies. 1st-Party Cookie Protection Unlike 3rd-party cookies, 1st-party cookies are less likely to be involved in cross-site tracking because they can only be retrieved from the site where they were originally created. However, 1st-party cookies can still be used to re-identify you when you later return to a website. This can be helpful when used to recognize that you’re still signed in, but 1st-party cookies can also be used to monitor your activity on sites over time and facilitate cross-site tracking. That’s because identifiers stored in 1st-party cookies can be sent to 3rd-party companies when their requests are directly embedded in the content of a website. To protect against this, we first block most embedded 3rd-party tracking requests before they even have a chance to create or access 1st-party cookies, because we stop those requests from loading with 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection . We also do the same for many 3rd-party requests that are disguised as 1st parties with CNAME Cloaking Protection . We're sometimes unable to block 3rd-party tracking requests because doing so would break site functionality. Since these unblocked 3rd parties may be able to set 1st-party cookies, we automatically set a 24-hour expiration on those cookies to limit their privacy impact. In addition, we set a 7-day expiration for all other 1st-party cookies created by scripts. We may make a limited exception when these rules would prevent you from signing in to a site or to otherwise preserve essential site functionality.

CNAME Cloaking Protection Some 3rd-party trackers disguise their real (origin) domains as subdomains of the website they’re hiding on, so they appear to belong to the website owner (1st party). This can help them escape common 3rd-party tracking protections. For example, metrics.example.com looks like it belongs to the example.com website owner, but the metrics.example.com subdomain may actually have a 3rd-party tracking company behind it. We identify 3rd-party domains trying to track you in this way through our open-source Tracker Radar crawl. We then help protect against CNAME cloaking by treating those domains as proper 3rd parties, such that we can then apply 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection and other web tracking protections. This type of protection is not offered in most popular browsers by default . Platform Support Firefox extension Treats 1st-party requests on our CNAME list as 3rd parties.

Windows app Treats 1st-party requests on our CNAME list as 3rd parties. Fingerprinting Protection Some companies try to combine specific information about your browser and device information to create a unique identifier for you that can let them follow you around the web. This widespread tracking technique is known as “fingerprinting” or “device fingerprinting” and is one way tracking companies try to get around cookie tracking protections. They do this by running JavaScript code and using browser APIs to ask the browser to reveal and return information about itself and the device it’s running on (for example, screen size and CPU type). To protect against this, we block many fingerprinting scripts before they can even load with our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection . In addition, we override many of the browser APIs used for fingerprinting to make them return either no information or alternative information that’s less useful for fingerprinting. We will only make a limited exception when it would prevent you from signing in to a site or to otherwise preserve essential site functionality. You can review our open-source code for this feature.

Smarter Encryption (HTTPS Upgrading) If the web address you are visiting starts with http:// , that means the Internet connection to the website is unencrypted, and everything you do or see on that website is vulnerable to network onlookers, including the specific page you are on and any information you submit about yourself while there. If the web address starts with https:// (with an s at the end), the Internet connection is encrypted, and anyone trying to spy on you (like your Internet provider or Wi-Fi snoopers) can’t see anything beyond the website you’re going to. To offer Smarter Encryption (automatic HTTPS upgrading), we crawl the web continuously, look for sites that fully support HTTPS across their entire website, and maintain a list of the sites we find within our apps and extensions. You can review the open-source code for our crawler. If you try to navigate to one of these sites unencrypted (http), for example from a social media link, we automatically change to encrypted (https) for any site on our list. Some popular browsers only direct users to encrypted versions of pages in specific circumstances, such as when you navigate directly to a page in the address bar. Otherwise, they only offer additional HTTPS upgrading functionality if you opt-in to advanced settings or use certain modes (like private browsing). By contrast, Smarter Encryption covers all clicks and interactions as you browse the web, including clicks from social media, search engines, and other websites.

Windows app Upgrades a subset of our full list of domains that covers approximately 90% of search engine clicks. Link Tracking Protection The links embedded in websites, social media, and emails that we share and click on every day often contain additional URL parameters after the destination domain. While many of these parameters aren’t used for tracking purposes, others are added to specifically track your behavior across sites (for example: example.com/page.html?fbclid=your_facebook_account_ID ). We help protect against this type of tracking by removing many tracking parameters . We may make a limited exception when removing parameters would prevent you from signing in to a site or to otherwise preserve essential site functionality. This type of protection is not offered in most popular browsers by default . Platform Support Firefox extension Removes URL parameters on our list.

Mac app Removes URL parameters on our list from the first navigation request. Applying protection to subsequent links in a series of automatic redirects unsupported due to platform limitations. Windows app Unsupported, but on our product roadmap. Referrer Tracking Protection When content loads in a web browser, the browser and any servers through which the request passes along the way use metadata in what’s called the “header” to determine what to do with the request. Part of this header is known as the “referrer,” which allows a server to identify the last place a user was before they arrived on that site. Sometimes this is used for security checks (like when you sign in to a website), but it can also be hijacked by companies to send along additional data that could help them track and fingerprint you. By default, we “trim” (remove) some of the metadata in the “referrer header” that trackers could potentially use to track you individually. All 3rd-party requests are trimmed down to the hostname (for example, info.test.com/path?query becomes just info.test.com ). We may make a limited exception when this protection would prevent you from signing in to a site or to otherwise preserve essential site functionality. Please note that even in the absence of this feature, your DuckDuckGo search terms are never included in the referrer header. Read more .

Windows app Referrer headers trimmed to the hostname for all requests originating from a different domain. Embedded Social Media Protection When you visit a website that contains embedded content from social media companies (such as YouTube videos, Tweets, Facebook comments, or sign-in buttons), that content often includes tracking code that those companies use to link your user information (like IP address and browser details) with your browsing history. By default, we block social media embedded content from Facebook on our list of content types , which includes: sign-in buttons, videos, comments, posts, pages, and groups. We plan to expand this protection to additional social media content, including YouTube videos. You can easily unblock a particular piece of content to view it if desired. We may make a limited exception when this protection would prevent you from signing in to a site or to otherwise preserve essential site functionality. While social media companies will receive some user information each time you unblock a piece of content, this protection will help reduce what they know about you overall by default.

Google-Specific Web Tracking Protections Google AMP Protection Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) is marketed as a way to “make it easy to build fast websites” by serving them from Google, but Google can also use AMP to track users who read those pages. To help protect you against this form of Google tracking, we replace most Google AMP links when clicked with the original publisher’s website so publishers can directly serve you these pages, instead of Google. To do this, we extract the original publisher link where possible by recognizing the format of AMP. Otherwise, we load the AMP link in the background, and block all content from loading , separate from your normal browsing experience. This allows us to extract the publisher link, delete all data from that background load and then load the publisher webpage, as normal. This helps protect you from the additional Google tracking that may not be present on the original webpage. We may make a limited exception when this protection would prevent you from signing in to a site or to otherwise preserve essential site functionality. This type of protection is not offered in most popular browsers by default . Platform Support Firefox extension Google AMP links replaced wherever detected. Chrome extension Google AMP links replaced wherever detected. Edge extension Google AMP links replaced wherever detected. Opera extension Google AMP links replaced wherever detected. iPhone & iPad app Google AMP links replaced wherever detected. Android app Google AMP links replaced wherever detected. Mac app Google AMP links replaced wherever detected. Windows app Unsupported, but on our product roadmap. Google Topics Protection Google is attempting to replace 3rd-party cookies within their browser with an alternative tracking mechanism called Topics . For Google Chrome users, Topics can use your Chrome browsing history to automatically infer your interests and align them with a predefined list of topics (for example, “Child Internet Safety” or “Personal Loans”). A subset of this list is shared with websites and other tracking companies so they can target you with ads just as easily — based on your behavior and without your knowledge. The DuckDuckGo Chrome extension disables Topics from running in Google Chrome. We may make a limited exception when this protection would prevent you from signing in to a site or to otherwise preserve essential site functionality. You can learn more about Google Topics Protection and review our open-source code for this feature. Platform Support Chrome extension Google Topics disabled. Others Not applicable to other platforms. Google Protected Audience API Protection Like Topics, the Google Protected Audience API (previously known as FLEDGE) is another Google mechanism meant to replace 3rd-party cookies. Its ultimate goal is also to “re-target” you with ads — in other words, letting Google ads follow you from website to website . The Google Protected Audience API works directly in the Chrome browser and uses your browsing history to run ad auctions in order to re-target you better and without you realizing it. The DuckDuckGo Chrome extension disables the Google Protected Audience API from running in Google Chrome. We may make a limited exception when this protection would prevent you from signing in to a site or to otherwise preserve essential site functionality. You can learn more about Google Protected Audience API Protection (previously known as FLEDGE) and review our open-source code for this feature. Platform Support Chrome extension Google Protected Audience API disabled. Others Not applicable to other platforms. Google Sign-in Pop-up Protection Aggressive prompts to sign in using your Google Account are commonplace across the most popular websites, often popping up as soon as a website loads. Opting to sign in using your Google Account can give Google implicit permission to collect even more data about your activity on sites than they would typically have access to when you’re not signed in or if you chose a different sign-in method. To help protect against being misled into unwanted tracking, we block these annoying Google sign-in pop-ups by default on sites Google doesn’t own wherever possible. We may make a limited exception when this protection would prevent you from signing in to a site or to otherwise preserve essential site functionality. That means you can take back your choice to sign in with any account (including a Google Account) and use standard website sign-in forms instead.

Preserving Site Functionality We aim to deliver privacy, simplified. Part of our ethos of simplicity is not breaking website functionality in the process of blocking and restricting trackers. We develop our protections with this mind, and we use the following techniques to further this effort as we continue to expand protections. Surrogates Sometimes sites depend on code that loads from embedded 3rd-party tracking script requests in order to function properly. When our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection stops these from loading, it can cause sites to behave unexpectedly. However, we can sometimes create small pieces of code called “surrogates” that work around this tracker-dependent breakage so that we can still stop those trackers from loading. A surrogate works locally on your device, pretending to be a particular 3rd-party tracking script without actually doing any tracking. Surrogates replicate the expected script’s API structure with all tracking components removed, including any remote server calls. This lets us neutralize the parts that would have tried to track you while allowing websites to load and function properly. You can review our open-source code for this feature. Surrogates are not offered in most popular browsers by default . Platform Support Firefox extension Surrogates preserve privacy and usability for tracker-dependent breakage on our list. Chrome extension Surrogates preserve privacy and usability for tracker-dependent breakage on our list. Edge extension Surrogates preserve privacy and usability for tracker-dependent breakage on our list. Opera extension Surrogates preserve privacy and usability for tracker-dependent breakage on our list. iPhone & iPad app Surrogates preserve privacy and usability for tracker-dependent breakage on our list, but some usability issues may still occur due to platform limitations that cause 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection to block scripts before we have a chance to apply Surrogates. Android app Surrogates preserve privacy and usability for tracker-dependent breakage on our list. Mac app Surrogates preserve privacy and usability for tracker-dependent breakage on our list, but some usability issues may still occur due to platform limitations that cause 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection to block scripts before we have a chance to apply Surrogates. Windows app Surrogates preserve privacy and usability for tracker-dependent breakage on our list. Remotely Configured Exceptions If you’re using our app or extension and suspect that a website usability issue was caused by one of the Web Tracking Protections detailed on this page, you can let us know by submitting a Broken Site Report. You can also temporarily disable DuckDuckGo’s Privacy Protection for individual websites to troubleshoot the issue you’re experiencing. We review user-reported Broken Site Reports daily, and work to address these usability issues continuously. When one of our Web Tracking Protections causes issues to occur (for example, if users can’t sign in or can’t use a popular website), we may add a site domain or cookie to a temporary exclusion list for that protection. This preserves essential usability for all users as we work toward a better solution. All of our privacy apps and extensions rely on these open-source lists , which vary by platform and protection, to maintain a seamless online experience. Platform Support All platforms All platforms provide feedback channels for reporting tracker-dependent breakage. Infrastructure Domains Most websites cannot build all of their technology in-house and must rely on 3rd parties for site functionality. We don’t want to penalize websites for using a 3rd party so long as their use of that 3rd party doesn’t help track you across websites. In this way, we hope to encourage good 3rd-party script behaviors over time. We consider some domains on our list to be “Infrastructure Domains,” for example Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and tag managers, since these domains are often used to load website functionality (i.e., infrastructure, like images, videos, and site elements you interact with) from other 3rd-party domains. However, Infrastructure Domains can be used to load both tracking and non-tracking resources. Because blocking Infrastructure Domains from loading any resources creates significant site breakage and prevents sites from loading resources they rely on, we take the approach of evaluating individual resources loaded from Infrastructure Domains, and apply 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection to those specific resources that we observe participating in tracking, taking into account the potential for site breakage. In addition, we apply our other overlapping protections (like 3rd-Party Cookie Protection ) to Infrastructure Domains directly. For example, a domain that hosts open-source JavaScript libraries would be considered a CDN and thus not blocked by 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection, but any instance of the FingerprintJS fingerprinting library hosted on that domain would be blocked because it’s used to fingerprint you and track you around the web. Likewise, 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection doesn’t apply to Google Tag Manager, as we have not detected the tag manager itself participating in tracking, we’ve observed it associated with breakage on many sites, and it occasionally loads necessary features like site widgets and privacy-friendly analytics libraries. However, we continue to block tracking resources Google Tag Manager may load, such as Google Analytics, and we also block Google Tag Manager itself on sites where we’ve detected embedded fingerprinting code within it. Other Infrastructure Domains are treated similarly. Platform Support All platforms Infrastructure Domain categorization impacts how we build our tracker lists, which are shared across platforms. DuckDuckGo Private Search Ads Advertising on DuckDuckGo is done in partnership with Microsoft. Viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous, and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users on ad clicks: “when you click on a Microsoft-provided ad that appears on DuckDuckGo, Microsoft Advertising does not associate your ad-click behavior with a user profile. It also does not store or share that information other than for accounting purposes.” To evaluate whether an ad on DuckDuckGo is effective, advertisers want to know if their ad clicks turn into purchases (conversions). To see this within Microsoft Advertising, they use Microsoft scripts from the bat.bing.com domain. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions for their own ads that are shown on DuckDuckGo, 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not block bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks and 1st-Party Cookie Protection will expire any cookies set by these requests on the advertiser’s website after 7 days, but these requests are blocked in all other contexts. For anyone who wants to avoid this, it's possible to disable ads in DuckDuckGo search settings. And in any case, our other overlapping protections — including 3rd-Party Cookie Protection and Fingerprinting Protection — continue to apply, even in the context of DuckDuckGo ad clicks. We’ve chosen this approach because it allows us to continue shipping best-in-class privacy protections while working to guide the advertising industry to adopt more privacy-preserving technologies. We envision a future where ad conversion detection can occur anonymously. DuckDuckGo isn’t alone in facing this issue, and the browser community has been working on private ad conversion technologies for several years now. Safari is working on Private Click Measurement (PCM) and Firefox is working on Interoperable Private Attribution (IPA) . This work is important because it means we can improve the advertising-based business model that countless companies rely on to provide you with free services, making it more private instead of throwing it out entirely. We hope these efforts can help move the entire digital ad industry forward and make privacy online the rule rather than the exception. Platform Support All platforms All platforms support DuckDuckGo Private Search Ads. Everyday Privacy Controls The Fire Button As you visit websites, everyday data, like regular cookies and browser storage, builds up locally in the browser. We’ve made it simple to clear data like this from the DuckDuckGo app’s local storage on your device with the “Fire Button.” This type of protection is not offered in most popular browsers by default . The Fire Button erases traces of websites that you’ve visited (like cookies, website caches, and favicons), browsing session information (like open tabs, back button history, and visited URLs), and permissions you’ve granted to websites (like geolocation, camera, and microphone settings). Our apps offer additional control, where you can also make specific sites partially immune to the Fire Button by “Fireproofing” them. Fireproofing a website keeps some helpful data around, like 1st-party cookies and storage that would otherwise be cleared out by the Fire Button, so you can stay signed in. From DuckDuckGo app Settings, you can manage your Fireproof Sites and choose whether you’d like to automatically clear tabs and data on restart. It’s important to note that the Fire Button will not clear the following: 1st-party cookies and storage for Fireproof Sites, bookmarks, downloaded files, or DuckDuckGo Search settings and associated storage. For example, we might use local storage to anonymously remember the fact that you’ve already dismissed a prompt to install our app so that we don’t annoy you by showing it again.

Note: As of May 16, 2024, a newly discovered bug in the operating system WebView2 component may temporarily prevent the Fire Button from instantly clearing fragments of browsing data from your device. This bug does not affect your privacy in our browser, the Fire Button still clears your browsing history and tabs, and any data remnants can be erased by closing the browser. Until this bug is resolved, you can restart your browser after using the Fire Button to ensure all data is cleared immediately. Cookie Pop-up Protection Cookie consent pop-ups often use dark design patterns to get you to accept the least private option. When DuckDuckGo detects a cookie pop-up on sites you visit, we can try to automatically set your cookie preferences to maximize privacy and minimize cookies, then close the pop-up. For sites that don't provide an option to manage cookie preferences on these pop-ups, we try to hide the pop-up instead using a combination of filter rules from open-source lists like EasyList Cookie List and our own cosmetic rules. In these cases, automatically hiding the pop-up is often still more private than selecting one of the limited options made available (e.g., “Accept All Cookies”). We currently offer coverage for most of the top 10,000 websites in the US, UK and EU and plan to expand coverage to additional websites over time.

When you click on a link in our results page, your search terms are not sent to the site that you click on, which can be the case on other search engines due to something called HTTP \"referers\" . On modern browsers we accomplish this by adding a small piece of code to our page called Meta referrer . Some browsers (especially older ones) do not support this standard, however. For those browsers, and also in situations where meta referrer doesn't work, we send the request back to our servers to remove search terms. This redirect goes through r.duckduckgo.com. You can disable this privacy feature. To do that, go to the settings page , select Privacy , and change the option Redirect to Off . You also go through a duckduckgo.com redirect when you use a bang.

    "content": "Search Privacy How does DuckDuckGo improve its products while keeping search and browsing history anonymous? At DuckDuckGo, we don't track you, ever. That's our Privacy Policy in a nutshell. To improve our product, we develop completely anonymous ways to figure out how our products are being used. For example, all requests to improving.duckduckgo.com cannot be associated with any individual. We do not create unique cookies and, more generally, we architect our product and these systems so that we do not even have the ability to create a search or browsing history for any individual — it's privacy by design. We created this page to explain, in detail, how we improve our product. How We Anonymously Test Product Changes First, you might notice that when you search DuckDuckGo, there may be an &atb= parameter in the URL in your browser address bar. This parameter allows us to anonymously A/B (split) test product changes we make to DuckDuckGo. For example, if users in group A get blue links and users in group B get red links, this lets us measure how usage of DuckDuckGo is impacted by link color. For some product tests, we may need to ensure a consistent user experience across page loads or after interactions with an element on the page. In those cases, we may store non-personal data using local storage (e.g., the large and generalized user experience group you're in). But that information is only ever stored on your device and is removed after the test is complete. Second, we measure engagement of specific events on the page. For example, measuring when a misspelling message is displayed and clicked on our search results page allows us to test different misspelling messages and determine which one is helpful. If you're looking at network requests, these are the ones going to the one-pixel image at improving.duckduckgo.com and may include a &exp_[experiment_name]= parameter to allow us to compare the engagement of different groups in the A/B test. These requests are anonymous, and the information is only used by us to improve our products. We also occasionally work with other browsers to run similar completely anonymous tests to improve the DuckDuckGo Private Search experience within that browser. How We Anonymously Estimate How Many People Use DuckDuckGo You may notice similar atb.js or exti requests made by DuckDuckGo browser extensions and mobile apps. These requests help us anonymously count how many devices are using an experience. For example, our browser extensions and mobile apps will send an atb.js request with each search made. These requests allow us to count approximately how many devices accessed DuckDuckGo without knowing anything about those devices or the exact searches they made. Similarly, while using the DuckDuckGo browser on mobile and desktop, you may see network requests containing m_retention_segments , along with anonymous parameters related to when the browser was used. This gives us a more nuanced understanding of how people use our products over time (for example, how many people use our apps daily vs. monthly) without relying on IP addresses or other unique identifiers. Knowing how many users stick around or stop using our products helps us identify opportunities to improve the user experience and measure whether certain product improvements help users. If you’re using the DuckDuckGo app on Android version 11 or newer, you may notice a new folder in the Downloads directory named \"DuckDuckGo.\" Currently, we don’t store anything in the “DuckDuckGo” folder, though we might in the future. For example we might use the “DuckDuckGo” folder as the default location for files you download online using our browser. Right now, this folder just helps us estimate how many people are trying DuckDuckGo for the first time in a totally anonymous way — we simply check to see if the folder exists already, which means our browser has likely been used on that Android device before. Because hundreds of thousands of people install our Android app every day, it’s impossible for us or anyone else to use this folder to identify you or connect your behavior in the DuckDuckGo app to you personally. The “DuckDuckGo” folder is only created once per install, and you can delete it at any time. How We Anonymously Measure Search Performance While searching on DuckDuckGo, you may see &perf_id and &parent_perf_id parameters in certain network requests. These parameters allow us to measure the performance of essential components of a search engine, including performance of database and cache calls, fraud detection and rate limit functions, as well as return time and results processing upstream calls within queries. We use this data to help identify opportunities to improve the search experience, for example, to identify how we can deliver high-quality answers faster. The parameter values are randomly generated per search and are not associated with users, user agents, or IP addresses. How We Anonymously Measure Search Engagement For certain elements in our search pages, you may notice the &vis parameter being used in requests. This parameter allows us to measure usefulness by identifying which elements were actually visible on a page or received an interaction like hovering. Because of different screen sizes, visibility can be very different across devices (e.g., desktop vs. mobile vs. tablet). As users click on these elements, we use this interaction data to measure conversions. The parameter values are anonymous, grouped together in batches, and are devoid of any personally identifiable information. To monitor the success of certain features, we may count the number of requests for design elements hosted on metrics-content.duckduckgo.com -- for example, a particular type of button illustration. This domain and process only counts the number of times these elements were loaded; in other words, it is a privacy-respecting proxy that does not capture any identifying information. We Don’t Track You: It’s All Privacy by Design None of the above types of requests have personally identifiable information embedded in them, and we do not store any IP addresses associated with them. This is the case with all other requests to DuckDuckGo. And all these types of requests are fully encrypted in transit to DuckDuckGo so that nobody else can see them. To be clear, this means we cannot ever tell what individual people are doing, since everyone is anonymous . That is the limit of our statistical methods, since we are private by design. With these anonymous processes, however, we can still reliably determine what changes are generally working. We have developed these systems from scratch, instead of using third-party services, because of our privacy promise not to track you. We’re proud to be able to improve our site for you in a completely anonymous way! If you have any concerns, please feel free to contact us . Learn More Does DuckDuckGo Search track you?

The DuckDuckGo setting cookies are a reflection of your current settings as a URL (see below) but without the \"k\" parameter. For example, the region setting is notated with, \"kl\" and a Canadian region setting would look like kl=ca-en in the URL. The cookie for that setting, though, would be named, \"l\" and it's content would be ca-en. If your settings keep getting cleared, that's because you have some process that is clearing your cookies (or you are switching computers). You could make an exception for duckduckgo.com from that clearing out process. To avoid cookies altogether, you could use our URL parameters . To make the use of the parameters easier on the settings page there is a link entitled, Bookmarklets and settings data. Clicking this link will expand the Settings box and show you your settings as a web address (URL). You can set that web address as your homepage or as a bookmark/favorite, and then those settings should be respected thereafter (as long as you start from that page). If you save that URL you can also use it to load/restore your settings from the bottom of the settings page as well. For example, you can email yourself that URL and then easily restore settings on different computers. Finally, you can use the Cloud Save system to save your settings.

    "content": "Search Privacy How DuckDuckGo Keeps Your Local Search Results Anonymous At DuckDuckGo, we don’t track you, ever. That’s our Privacy Policy in a nutshell. For example, we do not create unique cookies and architect our product so that we do not even have the ability to create a search or browsing history for any individual — it’s privacy by design. There may be cases when you want more accurate location-based results like local weather and restaurants. We can still serve results for searches like these (including instant answers and ads) while keeping you anonymous. To do this, DuckDuckGo Search simply guesses your location using a GEO::IP lookup with the IP address that's automatically sent to us via your device; then we throw away both the guessed location and the IP address, per our Privacy Policy , saving none of that info on our servers. Our default search experience was designed so that we don’t need to request any additional information than what you are already sending. This process isn’t always accurate enough; for example, DuckDuckGo Search may end up assuming you’re hundreds of miles away from where you actually are, especially on mobile phone networks that route traffic through a central hub. That’s why we built an option that lets you improve the accuracy of your local search results. When you see a prompt like the one above, \"Use Location\" will let you share your browser location to improve the accuracy of results while still hiding your precise location from DuckDuckGo. Major web browsers have access to more accurate location information using a variety of techniques, including Wi-Fi databases, cell tower location databases, and GPS. When you see one of these standard browser prompts, you are being asked whether your browser can obtain this more accurate location for use by the webpage indicated. In our case, we engineered a solution to shield that more accurate location from us. The location returned by your browser is stored locally on your device. The next time you perform a local search, selecting “Use Location” will send us a random location nearby, while hiding your actual location from DuckDuckGo. We use that random location to generate your results, then throw it away. If available on your device, enabling Precise Location in your app permissions will yield the most accurate local results. If you’d rather choose a custom location instead, you can pick “Set Location on Map” instead of “Use Location.” This bypasses the browser location permission, but still keeps your precise location anonymous to us. The only time we’ll use your exact location during a search, rather than a randomized location nearby, is to ensure accuracy when you request map directions. In this case, the information is only used to generate your directions and is not saved on DuckDuckGo's servers. To be clear, this means that even if you opt-in to using a more accurate location, your searches will still be anonymous. Learn more about your browser’s location services As mentioned above, browsers use a variety of techniques browsers use to identify an accurate location, which may present their own privacy implications. These vary by browser and depend in part on the location service the browser uses. Most major browsers provide detailed information on the location service they use and its associated policies: Firefox (uses Google Location Services): https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/does-firefox-share-my-location-websites Chrome (uses Google Location Services): https://policies.google.com/technologies/location-data?hl=en-US#how-find Safari (uses Apple Location Services): https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204690 Edge (uses Windows Location Services): https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/location-and-privacy-in-microsoft-edge-31b5d154-0b1b-90ef-e389-7c7d4ffe7b04 Learn More Does DuckDuckGo Search track you?

We've discovered some malicious Chrome extensions, often with the word \"video\" in the name, are incorrectly sending searches to DuckDuckGo and Bing. Some of the extension names we've seen are \"My Video Grid\", \"Video Tips\", and \"My Vital Video\". DuckDuckGo is in no way affiliated with these extensions. However, we would like to help you resolve this issue. Please refer to Google’s official instructions for removing extensions from Chrome. Some extensions we suspect to be malicious are also listed below, where the company behind these extensions appears in the referrer header of search requests on DuckDuckGo that triggered our fraud detection. CoolSearches New Tab RecipeSearch GameVille If you have one of these extensions installed or suspect you may have installed a malicious extension, you can help DuckDuckGo identify and mitigate fraudulent requests to our search engine (sometimes known as “botty traffic”) by letting us know. To report an extension you think is malicious, send an email to ops@duckduckgo.com . If you email us, we may contact you using the email provided to troubleshoot the issue.

Below lists the main areas where we partner and guidelines for using our technology. Guidelines Since we produce our own extensions and apps for the major platforms, we've found people increasingly confused as to what was produced by us and what was produced by others. Please follow these guidelines when promoting your applications: Please don't use DuckDuckGo in the title. (There can be exceptions so please contact us if you think you have a case for doing so). Mentioning us in the description is fine. Please don't use Dax (our mascot). Please don't pair our search with something that has another privacy policy, like another auto-complete service that tracks people, as doing so gives users a false sense of privacy. Please don't include our search results in any sort of frame (whether desktop or mobile) that makes our site embedded within another Web application with the notable exception of browser integration. We simply don't have the rights to allow framing based on how we generate our search results . For clarity, browser integration where there is an address bar and our site (with branding) takes up the full screen is just fine and encouraged! Please don't use our URL parameters to strip our branding from our site. Please give us attribution where it makes sense, and where you do link back to the encrypted version of our homepage . If you have any questions about applying these guidelines in your specific situation, please get in touch. DuckDuckGo as a Search Option We have many partnerships with apps, browsers and distributions that include us as a search option: Browsers Linux distributions iOS Android If you want to add us as a search option, please contact our business development team , as we have some standard ways to easily make this happen. Get in Touch We're always interested in exploring more opportunities but we get a lot of inbound partnership requests, so it helps to be as specific as possible when suggesting a potential partnership. We simply don't have enough time to do everything right now, and so what we work on has to be compelling. Please send an email to bd@duckduckgo.com . Learn More What is DuckDuckGo?

    "content": "About DuckDuckGo How does DuckDuckGo make money? Private ads on our search engine It is a myth that search engines need to track you to make money. The majority of our revenue is from private ads on our search engine. On most other search engines, ads are based on profiles compiled from your personal information, such as search, browsing, and purchase history. Since we don’t have that information per our Privacy Policy , search ads on DuckDuckGo are based on the search results page you’re viewing instead of being based on who other companies and their tracking algorithms assume you are as a person. For example, if you search for cars, we’ll show you ads about cars. We’ve even created a way to show localized ads while still keeping you completely anonymous. See the Anonymous Localized Results help page for more information on how we do this technically. Advertising on DuckDuckGo takes the form of sponsored links that appear adjacent to search results. Viewing ads is privacy protected by DuckDuckGo and most ad clicks are managed by Microsoft’s ad network, though even in that case , “Microsoft Advertising does not associate your ad-click behavior with a user profile. It also does not store or share that information other than for accounting purposes.” We have a similar arrangement with TripAdvisor. This is generally how advertising appears on DuckDuckGo: If you think you see low-quality ads, for example, ads that seem irrelevant or suspicious, please use the 'Report Ad' link for the ad in question on the search results page and follow the prompts. Visit Advertise on DuckDuckGo Search to learn more about why you should advertise on DuckDuckGo. Visit Microsoft Advertising to start buying search advertising on DuckDuckGo. Subscription fees from Privacy Pro We also make money from subscription fees. Specifically, the monthly or annual fee that subscribers pay to access Privacy Pro , our three-in-one subscription service that includes a VPN , a Personal Information Removal service and an Identity Theft Restoration service.

    "title": "How does DuckDuckGo protect my privacy? - DuckDuckGo Help Pages",
    "content": "About DuckDuckGo How does DuckDuckGo protect my privacy? Quick Answer: If you’re like most people on the Internet, you use Google to search the web and Google Chrome to browse the web. That means, by default, Google can keep track of every single search you make and website you visit. On those websites, other companies may also track you. DuckDuckGo is an independent Google alternative that also lets you search and browse the web, but we don’t track your searches or browsing history, and our browsers and extensions help you block other companies from trying to track you. We believe the best way to protect your personal information from hackers, scammers, and privacy-invasive companies is to stop it from being collected at all. That's why millions of people choose DuckDuckGo over Chrome and other browsers to search and browse online. Our built-in search engine is like Google but never tracks your searches. And our browsing protections, such as ad tracker blocking and cookie blocking, help stop other companies from collecting your data. Oh, and our browser is free — we make money from privacy-respecting search ads , not by exploiting your data. Plus, subscribers to our Privacy Pro subscription service get three additional protections: a fast and simple VPN , a Personal Information Removal service, and an Identity Theft Restoration service. That’s how DuckDuckGo protects your privacy in a nutshell. Detailed Answer: Our product vision is to be the “easy button” for online protection. Our free web browser for Mac , Windows , iOS , and Android allows you to search and browse the internet just like Google search and Chrome, but comes packed with unique privacy protections working behind the scenes to protect and secure your personal information. These overlapping protections work together seamlessly to give you more peace of mind about privacy harms. We believe the best way to protect your personal information from hackers, scammers, and privacy-invasive companies is to stop it from being collected at all. We do this with a variety of protections: Our private search engine doesn’t track you or your searches. That means unlike Google Search, we don’t save or share your search history, such that we have no way tie your searches or website visits to you personally and we don’t keep profiles of our users. Tracker blocking that goes above and beyond what’s available by default from other browsers like Chrome. For example, our 3rd-party Tracker Loading Protection blocks hidden trackers from companies like Google and Facebook lurking on other websites before they even get a chance to load. This works with our other tracking-preventing features like Cookie Protection , Link Tracking Protection , Referrer Tracking Protection , Fingerprinting Protection , CNAME Cloaking Protection , and Embedded Social Content Tracking Protection to help stop companies from watching what you do online and capturing personal data. Smarter Encryption to ensure that more of the websites you visit and links you click are securely encrypted, relative to other browsers. Cookie Pop-up Protection , which automatically selects the most private option from the cookie consent pop-ups it finds and then hides them. The Fire Button , which allows you to easily burn recent on-device browsing data in one click. Email Protection , which can hide your email address with unique @duck.com addresses when signing up for things online that forward to your existing email address, after removing email trackers. Duck Player , a YouTube player that limits invasive ads and keeps video views from impacting your YouTube recommendations. App Tracking Protection , currently available in our Android browser, that helps block 3rd-party trackers in your other apps, even when you’re not using them. Global Privacy Control (GPC) to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites (through a header and/or JavaScript-based signal) not to sell or share your personal information. To be effective, our protections need to continually evolve to mitigate how trackers attempt to evade specific protections. That’s why we offer multiple types of web tracking protections, continually improve them, and work to introduce new and innovative protections. Note that our private search engine is also independently accessible at duckduckgo.com and as a built-in option in other popular browsers. However, if you just use the search engine, we cannot offer any privacy protection when you visit other web sites. To get that protection, you’ll want our browser or browser extensions. Our help page on web tracking protections details which protections are available on which platforms. In addition, our Privacy Pro subscription service includes three more protections: VPN : Secure your connection anytime, anywhere. Get full-device protection with the VPN built for speed, simplicity, and security. Available on Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android. Personal Information Removal : Find and remove your personal details — like your name and address — from sites that store and sell it, helping to combat identity theft and spam. Identity Theft Restoration : If your identity is stolen, a dedicated advisor will help you restore stolen accounts, recover financial losses, and correct your credit report. Brought to you by Iris (Iris Powered by Generali) — a world leader in identity theft restoration. Learn More What is DuckDuckGo? What product improvements has DuckDuckGo made recently?
