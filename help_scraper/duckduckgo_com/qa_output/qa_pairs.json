    "question": "How We Anonymously Test Product Changes",
    "answer": "First, you might notice that when you search DuckDuckGo, there may be an &atb= parameter in the URL in your browser address bar. This parameter allows us to anonymously A/B (split) test product changes we make to DuckDuckGo. For example, if users in group A get blue links and users in group B get red links, this lets us measure how usage of DuckDuckGo is impacted by link color. For some product tests, we may need to ensure a consistent user experience across page loads or after interactions with an element on the page. In those cases, we may store non-personal data using local storage (e.g., the large and generalized user experience group you're in). But that information is only ever stored on your device and is removed after the test is complete."

    "question": "How We Anonymously Estimate How Many People Use DuckDuckGo",
    "answer": "You may notice similar atb.js or exti requests made by DuckDuckGo browser extensions and mobile apps. These requests help us anonymously count how many devices are using an experience. For example, our browser extensions and mobile apps will send an atb.js request with each search made. These requests allow us to count approximately how many devices accessed DuckDuckGo without knowing anything about those devices or the exact searches they made."

    "question": "How We Anonymously Measure Search Performance",
    "answer": "While searching on DuckDuckGo, you may see &perf_id and &parent_perf_id parameters in certain network requests. These parameters allow us to measure the performance of essential components of a search engine, including performance of database and cache calls, fraud detection and rate limit functions, as well as return time and results processing upstream calls within queries. We use this data to help identify opportunities to improve the search experience, for example, to identify how we can deliver high-quality answers faster. The parameter values are randomly generated per search and are not associated with users, user agents, or IP addresses."

    "url": "https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy/atb",
    "question": "How We Anonymously Measure Search Engagement",
    "answer": "For certain elements in our search pages, you may notice the &vis parameter being used in requests. This parameter allows us to measure usefulness by identifying which elements were actually visible on a page or received an interaction like hovering. Because of different screen sizes, visibility can be very different across devices (e.g., desktop vs. mobile vs. tablet). As users click on these elements, we use this interaction data to measure conversions. The parameter values are anonymous, grouped together in batches, and are devoid of any personally identifiable information."

    "question": "Is Personal Information Removal traffic still hidden from my ISP if it bypasses the VPN?",
    "answer": "Yes. When the VPN is on, automated scans and removal requests from Personal Information Removal are still hidden from your Internet service provider even when “allow traffic to bypass the VPN” is on. That’s because we still route DNS queries for data broker sites through the VPN, sending them through our own DNS resolver instead of your ISP, which adds an additional privacy layer to the VPN."

    "answer": "When a record becomes overdue, Personal Information Removal will continue to monitor the record and check to see if it has been removed every few days. Overdue records are usually removed eventually, but in some cases the site may not honor the original removal request."

    "answer": "The time it takes to remove your information varies from site to site. Some sites process removal requests within 24 hours, while others can take up to 6 weeks. Most removal requests just take a few days. Once Personal Information Removal finds your info on a site, it begins the removal process immediately."

    "question": "Why does my personal information still turn up in search results?",
    "answer": "Personal Information Removal targets data brokers and people-search sites, but your information may exist on other sites that can still appear in search results. Search engines may also still show your information on cached data broker site results until it crawls the updated site again. The timing with which different search engines update their results varies but, over time, Personal Information Removal should reduce how much of your information turns up in search results overall but cannot completely prevent it from reappearing over time."

    "question": "Can my personal info reappear on people-search sites after removal?",

    "url": "https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy-pro/personal-information-removal/privacy",
    "question": "How does Personal Information Removal keep my personal information provided for scanning secure?",
    "answer": "Unlike other services, Personal Information Removal happens from your device and not on remote servers. For example, all the information you provide during setup, like your name and age, is stored locally on your device. Removal requests to data broker sites are also submitted directly from your device. This too is unlike most other services where removal requests are initiated on remote servers. The only personal information we may receive in this process are confirmation emails from data broker sites, which we automatically handle for you and then delete within 72 hours."

That means any of your personal info that was previously removed may start showing up on data broker sites again, and we will no longer be assisting with removing it."

    "question": "Why do I experience slower internet speeds?",
    "answer": "As with any VPN, Internet speeds will decrease slightly because your device traffic must go through the extra step of traveling through an external VPN server before accessing the internet and returning to your device. However, the DuckDuckGo VPN is designed to minimize any impact on Internet speed."

    "answer": "Enabling the DuckDuckGo VPN establishes a secure, encrypted connection (VPN tunnel) between your device and one of our VPN servers.

    "answer": "Unlike other browsers and password managers, you won’t have to set up another account to remember or autofill passwords in DuckDuckGo.

    "answer": "Your Recovery Code is the only way to recover your synced data if you lose access to all the devices on which you have enabled DuckDuckGo Sync & Backup.

    "answer": "Setting up Sync & Backup on more than one device makes your bookmarks and passwords easily accessible on each of your devices.

    "answer": "No, unfortunately not – that’s why it’s important to keep your Recovery Code in a safe place, and/or use Sync & Backup on multiple devices. Because Sync & Backup is end-to-end encrypted, DuckDuckGo does not have your Recovery Code and cannot provide access to your data in this scenario."

    "question": "How are favorites different than bookmarks?",
    "answer": "The DuckDuckGo browser lets you mark certain bookmarks as a “favorites.” For quick access, favorited bookmarks are displayed in convenient locations, such as the New Tab page. Marking a bookmark as a favorite on one device type will not result in it being marked as a favorite on other devices by default, even if you’ve turned on Sync & Backup."

Cybercriminals use phishing to trick people into giving them personal information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers. They also try to get people to download malware that can infect phones or computers to cause damage or extract personal information. Phishing and malware protection is designed to alert you to sites that have been flagged for making phishing attempts or hosting malware. You can disable this feature in the DuckDuckGo browser settings menu."

    "question": "How does phishing and malware protection work anonymously in DuckDuckGo browsers?",
    "answer": "To start, your browser needs to know which websites have been flagged for phishing or malware. This list of sites is provided to us by our partner, Netcraft , and we store the list on our servers. Your browser downloads a version of this list from DuckDuckGo so it’s available locally on your device. When you navigate to a site, your browser first checks the site against the list stored on your device. If the site is on the list, your browser shows a warning message that gives you the option to navigate away safely or to continue to the site at your own risk."

    "question": "3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection",
    "answer": "When you visit a website, the web address (URL) in your browser’s address bar tells your browser where to go. What you may not realize, is that sites also try to load other URLs in the background while your destination page is loading. Many of those URLs come from other companies, commonly referred to as “3rd parties.”"

  },
  {
    "url": "https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy/web-tracking-protections",
    "question": "1st-Party Cookie Protection",
    "answer": "Unlike 3rd-party cookies, 1st-party cookies are less likely to be involved in cross-site tracking because they can only be retrieved from the site where they were originally created. However, 1st-party cookies can still be used to re-identify you when you later return to a website. This can be helpful when used to recognize that you’re still signed in, but 1st-party cookies can also be used to monitor your activity on sites over time and facilitate cross-site tracking. That’s because identifiers stored in 1st-party cookies can be sent to 3rd-party companies when their requests are directly embedded in the content of a website."

    "url": "https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy/web-tracking-protections",
    "question": "CNAME Cloaking Protection",
    "answer": "Some 3rd-party trackers disguise their real (origin) domains as subdomains of the website they’re hiding on, so they appear to belong to the website owner (1st party). This can help them escape common 3rd-party tracking protections. For example, metrics.example.com looks like it belongs to the example.com website owner, but the metrics.example.com subdomain may actually have a 3rd-party tracking company behind it."

If the web address starts with https:// (with an s at the end), the Internet connection is encrypted, and anyone trying to spy on you (like your Internet provider or Wi-Fi snoopers) can’t see anything beyond the website you’re going to."

    "question": "Referrer Tracking Protection",
    "answer": "When content loads in a web browser, the browser and any servers through which the request passes along the way use metadata in what’s called the “header” to determine what to do with the request. Part of this header is known as the “referrer,” which allows a server to identify the last place a user was before they arrived on that site. Sometimes this is used for security checks (like when you sign in to a website), but it can also be hijacked by companies to send along additional data that could help them track and fingerprint you."

    "question": "Google Topics Protection",
    "answer": "Google is attempting to replace 3rd-party cookies within their browser with an alternative tracking mechanism called Topics . For Google Chrome users, Topics can use your Chrome browsing history to automatically infer your interests and align them with a predefined list of topics (for example, “Child Internet Safety” or “Personal Loans”). A subset of this list is shared with websites and other tracking companies so they can target you with ads just as easily — based on your behavior and without your knowledge."

    "question": "Google Protected Audience API Protection",
    "answer": "Like Topics, the Google Protected Audience API (previously known as FLEDGE) is another Google mechanism meant to replace 3rd-party cookies. Its ultimate goal is also to “re-target” you with ads — in other words, letting Google ads follow you from website to website . The Google Protected Audience API works directly in the Chrome browser and uses your browsing history to run ad auctions in order to re-target you better and without you realizing it."

    "answer": "Aggressive prompts to sign in using your Google Account are commonplace across the most popular websites, often popping up as soon as a website loads. Opting to sign in using your Google Account can give Google implicit permission to collect even more data about your activity on sites than they would typically have access to when you’re not signed in or if you chose a different sign-in method."

    "question": "DuckDuckGo Private Search Ads",
    "answer": "Advertising on DuckDuckGo is done in partnership with Microsoft. Viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous, and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users on ad clicks: “when you click on a Microsoft-provided ad that appears on DuckDuckGo, Microsoft Advertising does not associate your ad-click behavior with a user profile. It also does not store or share that information other than for accounting purposes.”"

    "answer": "As you visit websites, everyday data, like regular cookies and browser storage, builds up locally in the browser. We’ve made it simple to clear data like this from the DuckDuckGo app’s local storage on your device with the “Fire Button.” This type of protection is not offered in most popular browsers by default ."

    "question": "Cookie Pop-up Protection",
    "answer": "Cookie consent pop-ups often use dark design patterns to get you to accept the least private option. When DuckDuckGo detects a cookie pop-up on sites you visit, we can try to automatically set your cookie preferences to maximize privacy and minimize cookies, then close the pop-up. For sites that don't provide an option to manage cookie preferences on these pop-ups, we try to hide the pop-up instead using a combination of filter rules from open-source lists like EasyList Cookie List and our own cosmetic rules. In these cases, automatically hiding the pop-up is often still more private than selecting one of the limited options made available (e.g., “Accept All Cookies”). We currently offer coverage for most of the top 10,000 websites in the US, UK and EU and plan to expand coverage to additional websites over time."

  },
  {
    "url": "https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/settings/cloud-save",
    "question": "How does it work?",
    "answer": "Your passphrase is used to generate a key using the Secure Hash Algorithm known as SHA-2 , using a 512 bit key. Your passphrase never leaves the browser, only the key and the settings file associated with it. We save the settings file on Amazon S3 using the generated key as the name. In the interest of transparency, this data is not encrypted: you can see exactly what information we store. Passphrases cannot feasibly be reverse engineered from a key - even if you could do that, there is no point since all the information is there in the open, unencrypted, provided you know the key. DuckDuckGo does not ever know your passphrase."

  {
    "url": "https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/settings/cloud-save",
    "question": "I forgot my passphrase. Can you recover it?",
    "answer": "No. Unless you deleted your settings, the settings file will still be there but we have no way of associating it with you. We cannot reverse the passphrase key generation. We don't associate your IP address or browser fingerprint or any other information with the file."

    "answer": "It is a myth that search engines need to track you to make money. The majority of our revenue is from private ads on our search engine. On most other search engines, ads are based on profiles compiled from your personal information, such as search, browsing, and purchase history. Since we don’t have that information per our Privacy Policy , search ads on DuckDuckGo are based on the search results page you’re viewing instead of being based on who other companies and their tracking algorithms assume you are as a person. For example, if you search for cars, we’ll show you ads about cars. We’ve even created a way to show localized ads while still keeping you completely anonymous. See the Anonymous Localized Results help page for more information on how we do this technically."
